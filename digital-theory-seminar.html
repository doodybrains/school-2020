    <h1>Digital Theory Seminar: Simondon and Cybernetics</h1>

      <h2>"Cybernetics, Purpose, and Natural-Artificial Analogies" A. Rosenblueth, N.Wiener, and J. Bigelow<br><br>N. Wiener, “Cybernetics in History” and “Progress and Entropy”.<br><br>J. Riskin, “Outside In,”</h2>

      <p>
        <em>notes on weiner, "cybernetics in history"</em> the purpose of cybernetics as being able to "attack the problem of control and communication" and also to <strong>classify</strong> the problems themselves
        <br><br>
        <strong>the many ramification of the theory of messages</strong>
        weiner defines cybernetics as the study of messages as a way of controlling machines and society, the study of computation and automation, how these relate to psychology and the nervous system. all falling under the umbrella of <em>probablistic theory</em>, which was first shaped by Willard Gibbs.
        <br><br>
        <em>society can only be understood through a study of the messages and the communications facilities which belong to it</em> and it is through this study and weiner is interested in machine to man, man to man, machine to machine interactions.
        <em>entropy as the introduction of randomness, as a measure of disorganization</em>, weiner states that in regards to control and communication <em>we are always fighting nature's tendency to degrade the organized and destroy the meaningful</em>. is he saying here that randomness, or the non-classifiable, is of less meaning?
        <br><br>
        <strong>information is a name for the content of what is exchanged with the outer world</strong> and that to live is to process the information while adjusting to our environments so that we can live effectively in that environment, weiner says that to live effectively is to live with adequate information and so communication and control are the <em>essence</em> of man's inner life. scientists have always been concerned with the transmission of information. Fermat studied the optics of light and formulated the principle that light will always follow the shortest path. Huygens developed the principle that light spreads by forming spheres which in their shape propate the light. Leibnitz saw the whole world as an organization of beings created by God. Einstein's theory of relativity and Gibb's statistical mechanics are in sharp contrast because Einstein does not consider probablility. both views give way to a physics that sees the world as happening in relation to it being observed.
        <br><br>
        <strong>messages are themselves a form of pattern and organization</strong> if entropy is the measure of disorganization then information carried through messages is a measure of organization. does this mean that if information is carried at all by the means of a message that there is some inherent organization which could be analyzed? the information carried by messages can be viewed as the opposite of disorganization. weiner writes that <em>the more probable the message, the less information it gives</em> <mark>so the more likely the message is to appear the less likely it is going to have information or the less likely the information is going to be useful, illuminating, descriptive etc?</mark>
        <br><br>
        weiner is attempting to now differentiate between <em>closed, clockwork machines</em> and modern automated machines. the former having no communication with the outside world and only existing and responding the messages from a pre-set pattern embedded within its machine. i suppose for simondon this would be an abstract machine of sorts in which each part of the machine serves a single function. weiner argues that more automated machines, such as the automatic door opener, unlike closed, clockwork machines, <em>posess sense organs</em> or receptors that are build to receive messages from external inputs. and like animals, which posess the ability to keep a record of the effects of the external enviroment on their beings, machines should also be able to bake in the effects of the external environment, so that they can use that sensory memory to respond accordingly.
        <br><br>
        weiner defines <em>feedback</em> as <strong>the control of the machine on the basis of its actual performance rather than its expected performance</strong> its main purpose being to create a temporal reversal of entropy, in other words, the machine should always be correcting itself towards a given goal
        <br><br>
        <em>in weiner's preface:</em>
        <strong class="quote">
          One interesting change that has taken place is that in a probabilistic world we no longer deal with quan­ tities and statements which concern a specific, real uni­ verse as a whole but ask instead questions which may find their answers in a large number of similar uni­ verses. Thus chance has been admitted, not merely as a mathematical tool for physics, but as part of its warp and weft. <br><br>This recognition of an element of incomplete de­ terminism, almost an irrationality in the world, is in a certain way parallel to Freud's admission of a deep ir­ rational component in human conduct and thought. In the present world of political as well as intellectual confusion, there is a natural tendency to class Gibbs, Freud, and the proponents of the modern theory of probability together as representatives of a single tend­ ency; yet I do not wish to press this point. The gap between the Gibbs-Lebesgue way of thinking and Freud's intuitive but somewhat discursive method is too large. Yet in their recognition of a fundamental ele­ ment of chance in the texture of the universe itself, these men are close to one another and close to the tradition of St. Augustine. For this random element, this organic incompleteness, is one which without too violent a figure of speech we may consider evil; the negative evil which St. Augustine characterizes as in­ completeness, rather than the positive malicious evil of the Manichaeans.

        cybernetics as the finding analogies between living things and machines, using feedback and self-regulating systems, to understand mechanics, through this cyberneticians <em>claimed to be able to build the living agency of an organic being into artificial machinery</em>
        <br><br>
        <strong>intelligent-egg, dead-sparrow model of the science of living beings</strong>
        <br><br>
        Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch demostrated cloning of an artifical embryo in 1885, 30 years later in 1921, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.U.R." target="_blank">a play</a> introduced the word "robot" in european languages. robot is from czech word <em>robota</em> which means servitude, in german and english, robot meant <em>serf</em>
        <br><br>
        william james >> animal-machinery requires consciousness as a steering machine, henri bergson >> french vitalist, thought of the vital impulse as driving the evolution of organic machinery
        <br><br>
        the play's writer, Capek, was primarily interested in interrogating a new and burgeoning industrial capitalism and its dehumanizing systems
        <br><br>
        earliest robot's were built by RJ Wensley in NY were built to check the water levels in reservoirs, the ideological robot-man as less technically advanced than exisiting machines of the 1920s such as the sewing machine and automobile
        <br><br>
        Robert-Houdins automated machines predated cybernetics theory by a century. around this time walter cannon coined the term <em>homeostatis</em> for self-regulating systems that are maintained by biological systems, a number of WWII era scientists in Britain, Kenneth Craik, William Grey Walter, Walter Ross Ashby (who built the Homeostat out of bomb control units) questions of whether or not machines also performed homeostasis.
        <br><br>
        In the US Weiner and Shannon were also working on theories of automata through materials of war. John von Neumann >> artificial and natural phenomena both contain systems which maintain themselves within changing external environments
        <br><br>
        weiner in his manifesto neglects early examples of cybernetic theory such as the ancient automata of ancient greece and notes that Descartes, even though he did in fact spend a lot of time discussing living automata and was the founder of the new mechanist physiology, did not take automata seriously.
        <br><br>
        “Philidog (1929), Robert-Houdin’s electric porter and stable boy (ca. 1860), or even Watt’s steam engine governor (1788).” preceded cybernetic machines a la norbert weiner.
        <br><br>
        trying to understand aristolean final causes teleology. final causes were purposes that preceded their events. i choose to drink the glass of water before filling the glass with water. classical mechanists rejected the idea that nature always had a will. weiner, rosenblueth, and bigelow also countered aristotle's teleology with the concept of <em>negative feedback</em> which is when the objects trajectory is shaped by its margin of error as it tries to reach its goal or fulfill its purpose. the key for w,r & b is that this kind of teleogy is always concerned with the present as opposed to what they took the problem of artistolean teleogy to be which was that the cause came after the effect (even though this wasn't actually what aristotle meant by final causes).
        <br><br>
        w,r & b's philosophy did account for another problem in artistotle's approach which was that objects had agency. they never give the object a purpose, instead the object is always acting in relation to its external inputs
        <br><br>
        early cybernet critics argues that not all telelogical objects should need a signal-emitting goal. cyberneticists then expanded upon the purposefulness of the object as not necessarily needing a signal-emitting goal but also an ability to adjust and therefore maintain its interiority irregardless of its external environment. George Canguilhem interpreted this behaviorist approach to telelogical objects as mechanics always and already being an extension fo the living. if a person makes a machine they are extending their mechanical functions outward into the machine.

        coeval with the founding of cybernetics, which married the more recently conceived idea of robot and also of homeostatis, ashby created the homestat.
        <br><br>
        on ashby's homeostat: the question of agency vs passivity. if the object is responding to its inputs/external forces and always trying to get back to an equilibrium is its agency in the fact that it wants to always be in a state of eq? or is it passive in that whatever happens outside of it it will always go back to eq without fail.
        <br><br>
        <strong>
          “Ashby himself, with Wiener’s encouragement, represented this appearance of purposefulness as a mechanical model of Darwin’s answer to Descartes. Descartes had argued that there must be at least as much perfection in the cause as in the effect (he had meant that the idea of a perfect and infinite God must have a source outside the imperfect and limited human mind). But Darwin had shown, Ashby wrote, that a “quite simple rule, acting over a great length of time, could produce design and adaptation far more complex than the rule that had generated it.”

        many automaton engineers, as early as the 14th century, were in some way connected to clock making. ashby was the great great grandson of London Watchmakers. the homestat could perform double feedback, the first being its ability to always, with coordinated effort between the magnets in each of the four parts of the machine, would turn back to equlibrium where they were all centered in their respective positions, the second being its ability to reset itself back to equilibrium even under the circumstances of a completely new configuration, which to Ashby meant that it shared traits with the human nervous system
        <br><br>
        extending Kant's theory of only living beings being able to self-organize, to machines, Ashby maintained Kant's distinction between appearance and reality, noting that self-organizing machines, like self-organizing living beings, were only <em>self-organizing in appearance</em>
        <br><br>
        <strong>
          “One could describe the same process differently by saying that you have forced the machine into successive new configurations until it arrived at one you like. In other words, in Ashby’s contraption, learning took the behaviorist form of a reconfiguration imposed from outside.”

        While Ashby was working on the homestat. Grey Walter was working on a different set of sentient machines:
        <strong>
          “Walter wrote that the Tortoises’ patterns of behavior illustrated a key principle in the study of animal behavior, namely that “any psychological or ecological situation” in which a feedback loop with the environment existed could “result in behaviour which will seem, at least, to suggest self-consciousness or social consciousness.”

        </span>
        <br><br>
        Weiner saw <em>voluntary feedback</em> as response to binary inputs, on or off, light or dark, volutary feedback as a "choice among feedbacks"
        <br><br>
        Weiner, Shannon, the whole lot. They attributed agency to objects which were always and only responding to an environment. The agency was wrongly attributed to the moth/bedbug machine, the mouse machine, the tortoise machine, the fox machine. Each of these things was most simply built of sensors which could react to 1 or 0, yes or no, on or off. The logic is in the external environment yet the cybs mistook this for self-regulating, autonomous, human-like, decision-making objects, when in fact, in line with behaviorist psych, the automation happens from the <em>outside in</em>
        <br><br>
        turing, through his early work on artifical intelligence, believed that <em>life</em> and <em>mind</em> were <strong>crucially diachronic mechanical phenomena</strong> meaning that they are both always changing in their relationship to one another?

      <h2>simondon. on the mode of existence of technical objects. introduction + chapter 1</h2>
      <p><strong>post-class thoughts and questions</strong>
        My understanding thus far is that abstract technical objects are those which while they might be a system do not incorporate objects which are themselves systems or at least multifunctional in their being. Concrete technical objects are those which incorporate objects that are already systems or multifunctional, such as the cooling fins example. Concrete objects also eventually internalize external concrete systems (like the factory) so that they can actively exist and participate within the milieu that the external system was also once a part of. A concrete object therefore necessitates that it be made up of other concrete objects and maybe this is also why a technical object can never truly be concrete because it's genesis is concretization itself?
        <br><br>
        While concrete technical objects might evolve from abstract objects their concreteness is born out of multi-functionality or its plurivalence which in turn creates margins of indeterminacy. The more plurivalent the object is the harder it is to determine what it's going to do in response to an external input?
        <br><br>
        I guess I'm left wondering what are the more concrete techno objects today? I find myself wanting to push back against the personal computer as a concrete object because I do truly question the plurivalence of everything inside of it not counting the chip. I'm thinking the laptop is an abstract technical object because once you remove the mouse and the keyboard you have nothing. I'm wondering what a personal computer might look like if we had language and theory, like that which Sim is suggesting, around the "nature" of a miniaturized computer chip? I think what Sim is asking us to do is to consider the abstract objects within technical objects or systems as irrelevant to a true understanding of the technicity, or the concreteness, or the plurality of the objects within, and to unpack their "essence" or "nature" in order to better "know" how these things sit in our world, how we can exist along side them instead of just viewing them as tools for us to use (the abstract?) or as self evolving entities which we have no control over (the truly concrete).

        <em>introduction, 15 - 17</em>
        la technique + les techniques translated to "technics" ~ the study of industry and of the mechanical arts
        <br><br>
        <strong>
          This study is motivated by our desire to raise awareness of the meaning of technical objects
        </strong>
        <br><br>
        technics, different from the word technique in english, but covering both in the translated text
        <br><br>
        <em>culture presumes that technical objects do not contain a human reality within them</em>
        <mark>
          i guess im still wondering what is culture here? what is nature? not sure how to situate
        </mark>
        <br><br>
        simondon wants technical objects to be valued just as human life is valued, oppositions between culture and technics, man and machine is false, misoneisum > hatred of innovation > less a hatred of machine and more a hatred of what is unknown or "foreign", culture recognizes <em>aesthetic</em> objects (what is an aesthetic object?) and regards technical objects as non-signifiers, only there to perform some kind of function, <strong>in this sense, what are the things that separate an aesthetic objects from a technical object?</strong>
        <br><br>
        "men who have knowledge of technical objects" will regard them if not as aesthetic objects then as <em>sacred</em> objects, "intemperate technicism", fixation on the metal, excessive attention to the tech, idolatry, worshipping physical object as god, fetish?, this passage...
        <br><br>
        <em>men who have knowledge...seek to justify their judgement by granting the technical objet the only status currently valued besides that of the aesthetic object, namely the sacred object. This, then, gives rise to an intemperate technicism which is nothing other than idolatry of the machine and which, through this <em>idolatry</em>, by means of identification, leads to a technocratic aspiration to unconditional power</em>
        <br><br>
        is this not how the "men who have knowledge" today operate in regards to technical objects??
        <br><br>
        philter ~ potion with magic power
        <br><br>
        <strong>the man who wants to dominate his peers calls the android machine into being</strong>
        <br><br>
        the android that these men seek to create, hide behind, and dominate with are in the end absent of any kind of interiority making them purely mythical beings..simondon wants to show that robots are not more a machine than a statue is a living being, it is just an imitation or rendering of a machine as a statue is an imitation of a living being?
        <br><br>
        sim is drawing parallels between perceptions of robots and perceptions paintings, we would never attribute will or a soul to the figure in a painting, and if robots are mere representations of machines then why would we attribute human qualities such as <em>sentiment</em> and <em>intention</em>?
        <br><br>
        he names two kind of contradictory attitudes that people have towards machines, one regarding them as devoid of true signifiers, as just utilitarian, <em>assemblages of matter</em> the second as robots, with intentions to put humans in danger, the first considers machines as not human and therefore, in the case of the culture that sim is talking about, as in service of humans, the second as a threat to humans
        <br><br>
        automation as of more social or economic signifigance than techinical, true technical progression is measured not in its ability to automate but that the operation of a machine has within it a "certain margin of indeterminacy"
        <mark>
          what is this margin of indeterminancy? is this where a human steps in? is there where the machine is meant to concretize?
        </mark>
        <br><br>
        sim says that this margin allows the machine to be <em>sensitive</em> to its surroundings or outside information
        <br><br>
        technicity as sensitiveness to outside surroundings of the machine, a machine with high tecnicity is an <em>an open machine</em>
        <br><br>
        all open machines <em>l'ensemble des machine ouvertes</em> <strong>always and already have man as their inherent organizer</strong>, sim writes that machines would need man in the same way that musicians in an orchestra need a conductor, <strong>this presupposes that there is some act to be carried out by the machines?</strong>
        <br><br>
        human gesture is crystallized into the structure of machines ~ the computer mouse :-)
        <br><br>
        modern calculating machines as not purely automated ~ they have a range of possibilities in terms of the <strong>switching circuits which allows the machine to be programmed through the reduction of its margin of indeterminacy</strong>
        <mark>so programs are the things that "control" a machine's indeterminacy?</mark>
        <br><br>
        <em>introduction pp 18 - 21</em>
        the task of understanding technical objects is best left to "engineer of organization who would be like a sociologist or psychologist of machines"
        <br><br>
        <mark><strong>open plurarility of techniques</strong></mark>
        <br><br>
        awareness of technical objects does require the presence of a technologist
        <br><br>
        "schemas of causality and regulation that constitute an axoimatic of technology" must me taught with the same prevalence as literary culture or mathmatical theorems, <strong>what does he mean that technics is as distenterested as the practice of the arts?</strong>
        <br><br>
        <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4891/ee4bd5f3befe00e3b9c12afc92750297e533.pdf?_ga=2.109303175.349374485.1568039519-608841563.1568039519" target="_blank">"Simondon suggests in Du mode, for example, that the use of living matter as a technology, as in the case of greenhouse flowers and fruits, inevitably ends up rendering living beings more artificial — that is, more “abstract”; more dependent upon constant human intervention — and he buttresses this claim with the assertion that greenhouse flowers will eventually be unable to reproduce on their own..."</a>
        <br><br>
        before technics, culture incorporated "schemas, symbols, qualities, and analogies"
        <br><br>
        the technical object has to be defined through its genesis before the relationships between it and other realities can be studied
        <br><br>
        the three levels of the technical object are: the element, the individual, the ensemble
        <br><br>
        <em>chapter one, part one, 25 - 28</em>
        technical objects are defined through their genesis
      </p>

      <p>
        machines are more analogous to one another not through their practical use but through their functionalities and structures, while a steam engine and gas engine are alike in their use, the steam engine is more analagous to a cross-bow. sim doesn't explain why. usage unites structures and operation under the umbrella of their speciies which draws its signification from relationships between how a human understands and uses the machines main functions. "the engine" can be many different things at any particular time, that the relationships between machines is transductive, the relationships varies from machine to machine depending on the the point at which we are considering the machine
        <br><br>
        we understand the automobile of 1950s to be posterior to the engine of 1910 not because it was made after or because it is better but because its inner workings of causal parts have been examined. all parts in a 1950s are wrapped up so tightly in a <em>regime of causality</em> that the engine cannot be anything other that what it is, it is therefore a <strong>concrete machine</strong> and the engine of the 1910s was an <strong>abstract machine</strong> in which each part does not necessarily depend on the other, does not repsond to the other, instead just responds to what is in front of them, completing on the task it was built to do
      </p>
      <div class="images">
        <img alt="combustion engine" src="images/5.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p>
        technical objects are the results of a series of convergences of functions, i.e. earlier engines had cooling fins located by the valves on the outside of the structure, they served only the purpose of cooling down the machine where it was subject to high pressure and heat, in 1950s engine the cooling fins also had the mechanical function of protecting the cylinder head of the engine from deterioration,
        <br><br>
        it is the convergence of these two "needs" of the machine that constitutes its moving away from abstraction and into concretization, where a compromise is made between parts and functions within the machine, i.e. best case scenario and best case scenario for rigidity; <em><strong>it is the progressive reduction of this margin between the functions of plurivalent structures that defines the progress of a technical object</strong></em>
        <br><br>
        and so, the abstract technical object is that in which each element that makes up its whole in entirely independent of the elements around it, the concrete technical object is one that is made up of elements which in one way or another greatly depend on one another, a system
        <br><br>
        <strong>the more plurivalent the technical object is the more it has progressed as a technical object</strong>, in any given epoch there is no infinite plurarity of possible functional systems
        <mark>is this what he meant by an open plurarity?</mark>
      </p>
      <div class="images">

      </div>
      <p>
        <em>chapter one, part two, 29 - 40</em>
        why do technical objects evolve? <strong>what are the reasons for this convergence</strong>
        <br><br>
        if technical objects do progress, do evolve, then it is not because of some extrinisic cause, i.e. economomic influence, it is because of an internal need
        <br><br>
        artisinal production = the abstract, industrial production = the concrete, but neither of these is the consequence of the lines of production, rather it is the condition of the production that makes for its evolution, industrial production can only exist if standardization exists first?
        <br><br>
        in the industrial produced object, the internal system of <strong>needs mold themselves onto the industrial technical object, which in turn acquires the power to shape a civilization</strong>
        <br><br>
        made-to-measure aspects of technical objects, such as custom details of a car, are inessential, uninformative to the structure and function of the objects itself
        <br><br>
        <em>chapter one, part three, 40 - 43</em>
        the rhythm of technical progress, when functional synergies are found between and within technical objects is when progress of a technical object is made

        there are two types of refinement in techno objects, ones which adjust the assembly of functions, greatly impacting the synergy between elements and ones which seek to minify unwanted consequences of antagosims between elements. these minor improvements, such as the rotating anode which increased power while reducing heat, are a step towards abstraction, if the rotating anode stops working then the entire technical object ceases to work, here sim in arguing that a technical object's progression does not occur in the abstract, continous, minor imporovements, instead it occurs in leaps, in the <strong>essential, discontinous improvements</strong> and through <strong>mutations</strong>
        <br><br>
        <em>chapter one, part four, 44 - 51</em> what are the absolute origins of technical objects? what is the absolute origin of what is considered "technical"?

      sim's absolute beginning is the condition of irreversibility of the electrodes as a <strong>technical essence</strong>
      <br><br>
      <mark>again trying to figure out, <strong>what is truly natural</strong>, sim is implying here that truly concrete objects are truly natural in that they can exist on their own? if this is true then im wondering what "natural" being exists without the a consistent intervention from some other being?</mark>
      <br><br>
      concrete >> natural, self-sustaining, whole, system, natural physical system
      <br><br>
      abstract >> primitive, split into non-interactive parts, physical translation of an intellectual system, the <strong>abtract technical object translates matter into a set of notions that are deeply separate</strong>
      <br><br>
      artificiality as the necessity of man to intervene in order to maintain the techno objects existence
      <br><br>
      <mark>studying automation is pointless if we don't understand the true interiority of technical objects? which can't be achieved if the technical objects is only being studied in relation to external impact?</mark>
      <br><br>
      sim throws shade on cybernetics because it is not concerened with the essence of technical objects and therefore cannot be a true study of the relationship between technical objects and living beings, instead technology must deal with the universality of technical objects
      <em>the only thing that counts is the exchange of energy and information within the technical object or between the technical object and its milieu</em>
      automata is not a species, technical objects are technical objects and they can have varying degrees of automata
      <br><br>
      <strong>living beings are concrete to begin with whereas technical objects are always concretizing</strong>
      <mark>what is mileu and what is not mileu for a technical object?</mark>

      <h2>turing, can machines think?</h2>
      <p>
        what happens when machines begin to imitate other machines? he wittles down the concept of digital machines to a limited set of criteria, one which had not yet been developed; computers were not yet solidified or ubiquitous. <br><br>
        turing invents what we theoretically know as a computer, at the time calling it a univeral state machine, in which it is able to imitate all other machines, if a discrete state machine can run a single program, the universal machine can be programmed to mimic any other machine; any machine can perform the instructions of any other machine
        <br><br>
        turing posits that by the end of the 20th century univeral machines could imitate humans, given enough storage and speed.
        <br><br>
        what is the relationship between computation and thinking???
        <br><br>
        one thing to note is that while we always assume at least that someone is thinking we can never truly know the interiority of their thinking, what their intention is irregardless of what is being said or even thought? we don't assume the same for computer. we assume that if the answer is "incorrect" then it is an error of function. we assume that the computer is always intentionally trying to give the correct answer, that there is no intention really.
        <br><br>
        this makes turing machines material-independent, reliant on the function, not what it is that is functioning, not what it is but how it is, not whats inside but how it is acting.
        <br><br>
        learning machines, treating a machine not like an adult but like child, and with "appropriate education" it can "think" like an adult
        <br><br>
        this idea of learning machines made me wonder, what if we really did treat machines like children? as in, what if we didn't hold them responsible for "unacceptable" behavior, instead we held their parents (programmers) responsible, or rather looked to them, how they "raised" this machine in order to understand its actions. what if we didn't really let machines out into the world for all of its adolescense? how might this change where the responsibility falls for a machine learning technology?
        <br><br>
        i guess i wonder what it would look like for machines to spend most if not all of their time "thinking" without actually carrying out any of their thoughts into actions, what kind of computational violence on the lives of humans might be prevented?
