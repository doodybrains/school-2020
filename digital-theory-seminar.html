    <h3>simondon ~ on the mode of existence of technical objects</h3>
    <p>
      <em>introduction pp 15 - 17</em>
      "This study is motivated by our desire to raise awareness of the meaning of technical objects"
      <br><br>
      la technique + les techniques translated to "technics" ~ the study of industry and of the mechanical arts
      <br><br>
      technics, different from the word technique in english, but covering both in the translated text
      <br><br>
      simondon distinguishes technics from technology, how?
      <br><br>
      "culture presumes that technical objects do not contain a human reality within them"
      <br><br>
      simondon wants technical objects to be valued just as human life is valued
      <br><br>
      oppositions between culture and technics, man and machine is false, misoneisum > hatred of innovation > less a hatred of machine and more a hatred of what is unknown or "foreign"
      <br><br>
      culture recognizes <em>aesthetic</em> objects (what is an aesthetic object?) and regards technical objects as non-signifiers, only there to perform some kind of function, <strong>in this sense, what are the things that separate an aesthetic objects from a technical object?</strong>
      <br><br>
      "men who have knowledge of technical objects" will regard them if not as aesthetic objects then as <em>sacred</em> objects
      <br><br>
      "intemperate technicism", fixation on the metal, excessive attention to the tech, idolatry, worshipping physical object as god, fetish?, this passage...
      <br><br>
      <em>men who have knowledge...seek to justify their judgement by grantint the technical objet the only status currently valued besides that of the aesthetic object, namely the sacred object. This, then, gives rise to an intemperate ( technicism which is nothing other than idolatry of the machine and which, through this <em>idolatry</em>, by means of identification, leads to a technocratic aspiration to unconditional power"</em>
      <br><br>
      is this not how the "men who have knowledge" today operate in regards to technical objects??
      <br><br>
      philter ~ potion with magic power
      <br><br>
      "the man who wants to dominate his peers calls the android machine into being"
      <br><br>
      the android that these men seek to create, hide behind, and dominate with are in the end absent of any kind of interiority making them purely mythical beings..simondon wants to show that robots are not more a machine than a statue is a living being, it is just an imitation or rendering of a machine as a statue is an imitation of a living being?
      <br><br>
      sim is drawing parallels between robots and paintings of humans, we would never attribute will or a soul to the figure in a painting, and if robots are mere representations of machines (or humans) then why would we attribute human qualities such as <em>sentiment</em> and <em>intention</em>?
      <br><br>
      he names two kind of contradictory attitudes that people have towards machines, one being regarding them as devoid of true signifiers, that they are just there as utility, <em>assemblages of matter</em> or that they are robots, with intentions to put humans in danger, the first considers machines as not human and therefore, in the case of the culture that sim is talking about, as in service of humans.
      <br><br>
      automation as of more social or economic signifigance than techinical, true technical progression is measured not in its ability to automate but that the operation of a machine has within it a "certain margin of indeterminacy", does this mean that the machine can act upon indeterminate inputs or that the machine itself is indeterminate in what it can do or how it can act?
      <br><br>
      sim says that this margin allows the machine to be <em>sensitive</em> to its surroundings or outside information
      <br><br>
      technicity as sensitiveness to outside surroundings of the machine, a machine with high tecnicity is an <em>an open machine</em>
      <br><br>
      all open machines <em>l'ensemble des machine ouvertes</em> <strong>always and already have man as their inherent organizer...but why?</strong>, sim writes that machines would need man in the same way that musicians in an orchestra need a conductor, <strong>this presupposes that there is some act to be carried out by the machines?</strong>
      <br><br>
      human gesture is crystallized into the structure of machines ~ the computer mouse :-)
      <br><br>
      modern calculating machines as not purely automated ~ they have a range of possibilities in terms of the switching circuits which which allows the machine to be programmed through the reduction of its margin of indeterminacy...so programs are the things that "control" a machine's indeterminacy?
      <br><br>
      <em>introduction pp 18 - 21</em>
      the task of understanding technical objects is best left to "engineer of organization who would be like a sociologist or psychologist of machines"
      <br><br>
      what is an <strong>"open plurarility of techniques"?</strong>
      <br><br>
      awareness of technical objects does require the presence of a technologist
      <br><br>
      "schemas of causality and regulation that constitute an axoimatic of technology" must me taught with the same prevalence as literary culture or mathmatical theorems, <strong>what does he mean that technics is as distenterested as the practice of the arts?</strong>
      <br><br>
      <a href="http://www.inflexions.org/n5_mitchellhtml.html" target="_blank">"Simondon suggests in Du mode, for example, that the use of living matter as a technology, as in the case of greenhouse flowers and fruits, inevitably ends up rendering living beings more artificial — that is, more “abstract”; more dependent upon constant human intervention — and he buttresses this claim with the assertion that greenhouse flowers will eventually be unable to reproduce on their own..."</a>
      <br><br>
      before technics, culture incorporated "schemas, symbols, qualities, and analogies"
      <br><br>
      the technical object has to be defined through its genesis before the relationships between it and other realities can be studied
      <br><br>
      the three levels of the technical object are: the element, the individual, the ensemble
      <br><br>
      <em>introduction pp 25 - 40</em>

    <h3>turing, can machines think?</h3>
    <p>
      what happens when machines begin to imitate other machines? he wittles down the concept of digital machines to a limited set of criteria, one which had not yet been developed; computers were not yet solidified or ubiquitous. <br><br>
      turing invents what we theoretically know as a computer, at the time calling it a univeral state machine, in which it is able to imitate all other machines, if a discrete state machine can run a single program, the universal machine can be programmed to mimic any other machine; any machine can perform the instructions of any other machine
      <br><br>
      turing posits that by the end of the 20th century univeral machines could imitate humans, given enough storage and speed.
      <br><br>
      what is the relationship between computation and thinking???
      <br><br>
      one thing to note is that while we always assume at least that someone is thinking we can never truly know the interiority of their thinking, what their intention is irregardless of what is being said or even thought? we don't assume the same for computer. we assume that if the answer is "incorrect" then it is an error of function. we assume that the computer is always intentionally trying to give the correct answer, that there is no intention really.
      <br><br>
      this makes turing machines material-independent, reliant on the function, not what it is that is functioning, not what it is but how it is, not whats inside but how it is acting.
      <br><br>
      learning machines, treating a machine not like an adult but like child, and with "appropriate education" it can "think" like an adult
      <br><br>
      this idea of learning machines made me wonder, what if we really did treat machines like children? as in, what if we didn't hold them responsible for "unacceptable" behavior, instead we held their parents (programmers) responsible, or rather looked to them, how they "raised" this machine in order to understand its actions. what if we didn't really let machines out into the world for all of its adolescense? how might this change where the responsibility falls for a machine learning technology?
      <br><br>
      i guess i wonder what it would look like for machines to spend most if not all of their time "thinking" without actually carrying out any of their thoughts into actions, what kind of computational violence on the lives of humans might be prevented?
