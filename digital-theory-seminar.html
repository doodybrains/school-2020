    <h3>reading Turing, can machines think?</h3>
    <p>
      what happens when machines begin to imitate other machines? he wittles down the concept of digital machines to a limited set of criteria, one which had not yet been developed; computers were not yet solidified or ubiquitous. <br><br>
      turing invents what we theoretically know as a computer, at the time calling it a univeral state machine, in which it is able to imitate all other machines, if a discrete state machine can run a single program, the universal machine can be programmed to mimic any other machine; any machine can perform the instructions of any other machine
      <br><br>
      turing posits that by the end of the 20th century univeral machines could imitate humans, given enough storage and speed.
      <br><br>
      what is the relationship between computation and thinking???
      <br><br>
      one thing to note is that while we always assume at least that someone is thinking we can never truly know the interiority of their thinking, what their intention is irregardless of what is being said or even thought? we don't assume the same for computer. we assume that if the answer is "incorrect" then it is an error of function. we assume that the computer is always intentionally trying to give the correct answer, that there is no intention really.
      <br><br>
      this makes turing machines material-independent, reliant on the function, not what it is that is functioning, not what it is but how it is, not whats inside but how it is acting.
      <br><br>
      learning machines, treating a machine not like an adult but like child, and with "appropriate education" it can "think" like an adult
      <br><br>
      this idea of learning machines made me wonder, what if we really did treat machines like children? as in, what if we didn't hold them responsible for "unacceptable" behavior, instead we held their parents (programmers) responsible, or rather looked to them, how they "raised" this machine in order to understand its actions. what if we didn't really let machines out into the world for all of its adolescense? how might this change where the responsibility falls for a machine learning technology?
      <br><br>
      i guess i wonder what it would look like for machines to spend most if not all of their time "thinking" without actually carrying out any of their thoughts into actions, what kind of computational violence on the lives of humans might be prevented?
