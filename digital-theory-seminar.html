      <h2>simondon ~ on the mode of existence of technical objects</h2>
      <p>
        <em>introduction, 15 - 17</em>
        la technique + les techniques translated to "technics" ~ the study of industry and of the mechanical arts
        <br><br>
        <strong>
          This study is motivated by our desire to raise awareness of the meaning of technical objects
        </strong>
        <br><br>
        technics, different from the word technique in english, but covering both in the translated text
        <br><br>
        <em>culture presumes that technical objects do not contain a human reality within them</em>
        <mark>
          i guess im still wondering what is culture here? what is nature? not sure how to situate
        </mark>
        <br><br>
        simondon wants technical objects to be valued just as human life is valued, oppositions between culture and technics, man and machine is false, misoneisum > hatred of innovation > less a hatred of machine and more a hatred of what is unknown or "foreign", culture recognizes <em>aesthetic</em> objects (what is an aesthetic object?) and regards technical objects as non-signifiers, only there to perform some kind of function, <strong>in this sense, what are the things that separate an aesthetic objects from a technical object?</strong>
        <br><br>
        "men who have knowledge of technical objects" will regard them if not as aesthetic objects then as <em>sacred</em> objects, "intemperate technicism", fixation on the metal, excessive attention to the tech, idolatry, worshipping physical object as god, fetish?, this passage...
        <br><br>
        <em>men who have knowledge...seek to justify their judgement by granting the technical objet the only status currently valued besides that of the aesthetic object, namely the sacred object. This, then, gives rise to an intemperate technicism which is nothing other than idolatry of the machine and which, through this <em>idolatry</em>, by means of identification, leads to a technocratic aspiration to unconditional power</em>
        <br><br>
        is this not how the "men who have knowledge" today operate in regards to technical objects??
        <br><br>
        philter ~ potion with magic power
        <br><br>
        <strong>the man who wants to dominate his peers calls the android machine into being</strong>
        <br><br>
        the android that these men seek to create, hide behind, and dominate with are in the end absent of any kind of interiority making them purely mythical beings..simondon wants to show that robots are not more a machine than a statue is a living being, it is just an imitation or rendering of a machine as a statue is an imitation of a living being?
        <br><br>
        sim is drawing parallels between perceptions of robots and perceptions paintings, we would never attribute will or a soul to the figure in a painting, and if robots are mere representations of machines then why would we attribute human qualities such as <em>sentiment</em> and <em>intention</em>?
        <br><br>
        he names two kind of contradictory attitudes that people have towards machines, one regarding them as devoid of true signifiers, as just utilitarian, <em>assemblages of matter</em> the second as robots, with intentions to put humans in danger, the first considers machines as not human and therefore, in the case of the culture that sim is talking about, as in service of humans, the second as a threat to humans
        <br><br>
        automation as of more social or economic signifigance than techinical, true technical progression is measured not in its ability to automate but that the operation of a machine has within it a "certain margin of indeterminacy"
        <mark>
          what is this margin of indeterminancy? is this where a human steps in? is there where the machine is meant to concretize?
        </mark>
        <br><br>
        sim says that this margin allows the machine to be <em>sensitive</em> to its surroundings or outside information
        <br><br>
        technicity as sensitiveness to outside surroundings of the machine, a machine with high tecnicity is an <em>an open machine</em>
        <br><br>
        all open machines <em>l'ensemble des machine ouvertes</em> <strong>always and already have man as their inherent organizer</strong>, sim writes that machines would need man in the same way that musicians in an orchestra need a conductor, <strong>this presupposes that there is some act to be carried out by the machines?</strong>
        <br><br>
        human gesture is crystallized into the structure of machines ~ the computer mouse :-)
        <br><br>
        modern calculating machines as not purely automated ~ they have a range of possibilities in terms of the <strong>switching circuits which allows the machine to be programmed through the reduction of its margin of indeterminacy</strong>
        <mark>so programs are the things that "control" a machine's indeterminacy?</mark>
        <br><br>
        <em>introduction pp 18 - 21</em>
        the task of understanding technical objects is best left to "engineer of organization who would be like a sociologist or psychologist of machines"
        <br><br>
        <mark><strong>open plurarility of techniques</strong></mark>
        <br><br>
        awareness of technical objects does require the presence of a technologist
        <br><br>
        "schemas of causality and regulation that constitute an axoimatic of technology" must me taught with the same prevalence as literary culture or mathmatical theorems, <strong>what does he mean that technics is as distenterested as the practice of the arts?</strong>
        <br><br>
        <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4891/ee4bd5f3befe00e3b9c12afc92750297e533.pdf?_ga=2.109303175.349374485.1568039519-608841563.1568039519" target="_blank">"Simondon suggests in Du mode, for example, that the use of living matter as a technology, as in the case of greenhouse flowers and fruits, inevitably ends up rendering living beings more artificial — that is, more “abstract”; more dependent upon constant human intervention — and he buttresses this claim with the assertion that greenhouse flowers will eventually be unable to reproduce on their own..."</a>
        <br><br>
        before technics, culture incorporated "schemas, symbols, qualities, and analogies"
        <br><br>
        the technical object has to be defined through its genesis before the relationships between it and other realities can be studied
        <br><br>
        the three levels of the technical object are: the element, the individual, the ensemble
        <br><br>
        <em>chapter one, part one, 25 - 28</em>
        technical objects are defined through their genesis
      </p>

        <img alt="gas engine" src="images/2.jpg" />
        <img alt="turbine" src="images/3.jpg" />
        <img alt="spring engine" src="images/4.gif" />
      </div>
      <p>
        machines are more analogous to one another not through their practical use but through their functionalities and structures, while a steam engine and gas engine are alike in their use, the steam engine is more analagous to a cross-bow. sim doesn't explain why. usage unites structures and operation under the umbrella of their speciies which draws its signification from relationships between how a human understands and uses the machines main functions. "the engine" can be many different things at any particular time, that the relationships between machines is transductive, the relationships varies from machine to machine depending on the the point at which we are considering the machine
        <br><br>
        we understand the automobile of 1950s to be posterior to the engine of 1910 not because it was made after or because it is better but because its inner workings of causal parts have been examined. all parts in a 1950s are wrapped up so tightly in a <em>regime of causality</em> that the engine cannot be anything other that what it is, it is therefore a <strong>concrete machine</strong> and the engine of the 1910s was an <strong>abstract machine</strong> in which each part does not necessarily depend on the other, does not repsond to the other, instead just responds to what is in front of them, completing on the task it was built to do
      </p>
      <div class="images">
        <img alt="combustion engine" src="images/5.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p>
        technical objects are the results of a series of convergences of functions, i.e. earlier engines had cooling fins located by the valves on the outside of the structure, they served only the purpose of cooling down the machine where it was subject to high pressure and heat, in 1950s engine the cooling fins also had the mechanical function of protecting the cylinder head of the engine from deterioration,
        <br><br>
        it is the convergence of these two "needs" of the machine that constitutes its moving away from abstraction and into concretization, where a compromise is made between parts and functions within the machine, i.e. best case scenario and best case scenario for rigidity; <em><strong>it is the progressive reduction of this margin between the functions of plurivalent structures that defines the progress of a technical object</strong></em>
        <br><br>
        and so, the abstract technical object is that in which each element that makes up its whole in entirely independent of the elements around it, the concrete technical object is one that is made up of elements which in one way or another greatly depend on one another, a system
        <br><br>
        <strong>the more plurivalent the technical object is the more it has progressed as a technical object</strong>, in any given epoch there is no infinite plurarity of possible functional systems
        <mark>is this what he meant by an open plurarity?</mark>
      </p>
      <div class="images">
        <img alt="aircraft cooling engine" src="images/6.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p>
        <em>chapter one, part two, 29 - 40</em>
        why do technical objects evolve? <strong>what are the reasons for this convergence</strong>
        <br><br>
        if technical objects do progress, do evolve, then it is not because of some extrinisic cause, i.e. economomic influence, it is because of an internal need
        <br><br>
        artisinal production = the abstract, industrial production = the concrete, but neither of these is the consequence of the lines of production, rather it is the condition of the production that makes for its evolution, industrial production can only exist if standardization exists first?
        <br><br>
        in the industrial produced object, the internal system of <strong>needs mold themselves onto the industrial technical object, which in turn acquires the power to shape a civilization</strong>
        <br><br>
        made-to-measure aspects of technical objects, such as custom details of a car, are inessential, uninformative to the structure and function of the objects itself
        <br><br>
        <em>chapter one, part three, 40 - 43</em>
        the rhythm of technical progress, when functional synergies are found between and within technical objects is when progress of a technical object is made
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <div class="images">
        <img alt="crookes tube" src="images/7.jpeg" />
        <img alt="coolidge tube" src="images/8.jpg" />

        <img alt="fleming diagrams" src="images/9.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p>
        there are two types of refinement in techno objects, ones which adjust the assembly of functions, greatly impacting the synergy between elements and ones which seek to minify unwanted consequences of antagosims between elements. these minor improvements, such as the rotating anode which increased power while reducing heat, are a step towards abstraction, if the rotating anode stops working then the entire technical object ceases to work, here sim in arguing that a technical object's progression does not occur in the abstract, continous, minor imporovements, instead it occurs in leaps, in the <strong>essential, discontinous improvements</strong> and through <strong>mutations</strong>
        <br><br>
        <em>chapter one, part four, 44 - 51</em> what are the absolute origins of technical objects? what is the absolute origin of what is considered "technical"?
      </p>
      <div class="images">
        <img alt="first diode" src="images/11.jpg" />
        <img alt="fleming's triode" src="images/10.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p>
      sim's absolute beginning is the condition of irreversibility of the electrodes as a <strong>technical essence</strong>
      <br><br>
      <mark>again trying to figure out, <strong>what is truly natural</strong>, sim is implying here that truly concrete objects are truly natural in that they can exist on their own? if this is true then im wondering what "natural" being exists without the a consistent intervention from some other being?</mark>
      <br><br>
      concrete >> natural, self-sustaining, whole, system, natural physical system
      <br><br>
      abstract >> primitive, split into non-interactive parts, physical translation of an intellectual system, the <strong>abtract technical object translates matter into a set of notions that are deeply separate</strong>
      <br><br>
      artificiality as the necessity of man to intervene in order to maintain the techno objects existence
      <br><br>
      <mark>studying automation is pointless if we don't understand the true interiority of technical objects? which can't be achieved if the technical objects is only being studied in relation to external impact?</mark>
      <br><br>
      sim throws shade on cybernetics because it is not concerened with the essence of technical objects and therefore cannot be a true study of the relationship between technical objects and living beings, instead technology must deal with the universality of technical objects
      <em>the only thing that counts is the exchange of energy and information within the technical object or between the technical object and its milieu</em>
      automata is not a species, technical objects are technical objects and they can have varying degrees of automata
      <br><br>
      <strong>living beings are concrete to begin with whereas technical objects are always concretizing</strong>
      <mark>what is mileu and what is not mileu for a technical object?</mark>

      <h2>turing, can machines think?</h2>
      <p>
        what happens when machines begin to imitate other machines? he wittles down the concept of digital machines to a limited set of criteria, one which had not yet been developed; computers were not yet solidified or ubiquitous. <br><br>
        turing invents what we theoretically know as a computer, at the time calling it a univeral state machine, in which it is able to imitate all other machines, if a discrete state machine can run a single program, the universal machine can be programmed to mimic any other machine; any machine can perform the instructions of any other machine
        <br><br>
        turing posits that by the end of the 20th century univeral machines could imitate humans, given enough storage and speed.
        <br><br>
        what is the relationship between computation and thinking???
        <br><br>
        one thing to note is that while we always assume at least that someone is thinking we can never truly know the interiority of their thinking, what their intention is irregardless of what is being said or even thought? we don't assume the same for computer. we assume that if the answer is "incorrect" then it is an error of function. we assume that the computer is always intentionally trying to give the correct answer, that there is no intention really.
        <br><br>
        this makes turing machines material-independent, reliant on the function, not what it is that is functioning, not what it is but how it is, not whats inside but how it is acting.
        <br><br>
        learning machines, treating a machine not like an adult but like child, and with "appropriate education" it can "think" like an adult
        <br><br>
        this idea of learning machines made me wonder, what if we really did treat machines like children? as in, what if we didn't hold them responsible for "unacceptable" behavior, instead we held their parents (programmers) responsible, or rather looked to them, how they "raised" this machine in order to understand its actions. what if we didn't really let machines out into the world for all of its adolescense? how might this change where the responsibility falls for a machine learning technology?
        <br><br>
        i guess i wonder what it would look like for machines to spend most if not all of their time "thinking" without actually carrying out any of their thoughts into actions, what kind of computational violence on the lives of humans might be prevented?
