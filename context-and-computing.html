    <h2>A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</h2>

    <p>
      Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.
      <br><br>
      We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.
      <br><br>
      Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.
      <br><br>
      You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.
      <br><br>
      You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different.
      <br><br>
      Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.
      <br><br>
      We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.
      <br><br>
      We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.
      <br><br>
      Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.
      <br><br>
      Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.
      <br><br>
      In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us.
      <br><br>
      You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.
      <br><br>
      In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.
      <br><br>
      Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.
      <br><br>
      These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.
      <br><br>
      We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.

    <h2>Myth: The Internet has no place, on the internet you have no face</h2>
    <p>
      John Perry Barlow, a cattle rancher, a <strong>cyberlibertarian</strong> political activist and lyricist for the Grateful Dead, wrote A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace in 1996 which really did its job in perpetuating this myth. I remember, in 2010, having never read this, feeling something close to this idea, being online and truly feeling like I was in a place that had no physical location, truly feeling like who I was in the physical world need not be who I was online. However, I don't agree with these ideas, mostly I don't agree with the format of these ideas, that they are in a kind of declaration, that it is declarative, that somehow JPB's needs are all people's needs, that the kind of independence he is seeking is the same independence all people online should seek. I do think there is power in the fact that people can gather in a non-physical online space where their identities can be fluid but that is not the same thing as saying that when you are online, you do not have a body, that the powers that be don't also affect how you get online, what you see online, how the systems that created the Internet are also the systems that created the military, how institutionalized racism precedes the material output of these technologies and so are inherently baked in. This is where JPB makes sweeping oversights, where he assumes that there is such a thing as a neutral, apolitical space. I would say that the most obvious argument against this myth is that removing human bodies from any equation where humans are participating is a political act with very serious consequences.

By removing bodies we remove the possibility of making material in the first place. In writing this response I think it makes the most sense to work backwards from Johanna Drucker's Performative Materialist and Theoretical Approaches to Interface. An interesting question here might be...what would the declaration of independence of cyberspace be if it were framed by performative materiality? Perhaps the idea of digital flux can already be read into JPB's statement when he says "transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications." But then immediately after he writes <em>"...but it is no where bodies live."</em> which is where I would jump back to Blanchette's distributed materiality which Drucker describes as not only being rooted in the acknowledgement of all elements in a system being material themselves but also <em>"locked into relations with each other that are governed by their material design"</em> I think this complicates JPB's concept of collective self-governance and the "we". Its kind of a "tyranny of structureless" situation. But also, from this distributed materialist point of view, the structures which allow for "transactions" are themselves material, and therefore the structures are acting and are political.
      <br><br>      <br><br>
Trevor Paglen touches on this in his essay Experimental Geography: From Cultural Production to the Production of Space noting <em>"The spaces humans produce, in turn, set powerful constraints upon subsequent activity."</em> My questions now are was what Walter Benjamin was positing also a kind of performative materiality? The idea that what is produced also itself produces a space. I'm reminded if an essay about facial recognition by Os Keyes in which they write "Because all technology that implicates gender, alters it; more generally, all technology that measures a thing alters it simply by measuring it." The mere act of measuring something, designing something, studying something, all alter the thing. The article ‘Speculative infrastructures’ at the urban margins notes <em>"While practices of remaking at the margins create means of access, they also simultaneously highlight for us the very biased politics of planning and design".</em> There is no doubt here that Barlow's idea of cyberspace was a design in itself, meant to exist on top of pre-existing material structures, both of which, the idea, and the material structures, work together to become political.
