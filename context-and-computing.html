    <h2>A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</h2>

    <p class="redact">
      <span><em>Governments</em> <em>Platforms</em></span> of the <span><em>Industrial</em> <em>Cyberspace</em></span> World, you weary giants of <span><em>flesh</em> <em>brogrammers</em></span> and <span><em>steel</em> <em>cables</em></span>, I come from <span><em>Cyberspace, the new home</em> <em>New York City, a land originally lived on and taken care</em></span> of <span><em>Mind</em> <em>by Lenape people</em></span>. On behalf of <span><em>the future</em> <em>no one actually</em></span>, I ask you of the <span><em>past</em> <em>present</em></span> to <span><em>leave us alone</em> <em>mind your own business</em></span>. You <span><em>are not welcome among us</em> <em>have done nothing to prove you care</em></span>. You <span><em></em> <em>should</em><span> have no <span><em>sovereignty where we</em> <em>say in how people living in New York City today</em></span> gather.
      <br><br>
      <span><em>We have no</em> <em>New York City has an</em></span> elected government, <span><em>nor are we likely to have one, so I address</em> <em>and while its deeply problematic, it’s not something</em></span> you <span><em>with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks</em> <em>should be building technologies for since they are often used for harmful surveillance tactics in the name of safety</em></span>. I <span><em>declare</em> <em>believe</em></span> the global social space <span><em>we are building</em> <em>that you have built</em></span> to be naturally <span><em>independent of</em> <em>dependent on</em></span> the tyrannies <span><em></em> <em> governments and people in power before</em></span> you seek<span><em></em><em>ed</em></span> to impose on <span><em>us</em> <em>people</em></span>. You have no moral right to rule <span><em>us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.</em> <em>people and the question is, does anyone?</em></span>
      <br><br>
      <span><em></em><em>If</em></span> <span><em>G</em><em>g</em></span>overnments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed<span><em></em><em>, then you should have no power at all.</em></span> You have neither solicited nor received <span><em>ours</em> <em>anyone's consent</em></span>. <span><em>We did not invite you.</em> <em>You were never invited.</em></span> You do not know <span><em>us</em> <em>people</em></span>, nor do you know <span><em>our</em> <em>the</em></span> world. <span><em>Cyberspace does not lie within your</em> <em>You have proliferated</em></span> borders. <span><em>Do not think that</em> <em>You thought</em></span> you <span><em>can</em> <em>could</em></span> build <span><em>it</em> <em>your platforms</em></span>, as though <span><em>it</em> <em>they</em></span> were a public construction project. You cannot. <span><em>It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.</em><em></em></span>
      <br><br>
      You have not engaged in <span><em>our great</em> <em>any meaningful</em></span> and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of <span><em>our marketplaces</em> <em>peoples knowledge</em></span>. You do not know <span><em>our</em><em></em></span> culture<span><em></em><em>s</em></span>, <span><em>our</em><em></em></span> ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.
      <br><br>
      You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, <span><em>we</em> <em>collectively people</em></span>will identify them and address them by <span><em>our</em> <em>their</em></span> means. <span><em>We are forming our</em> <em>You have formed your</em></span> own Social Contract. This governance <span><em>will</em> <em>has</em></span> arise<span><em></em> <em>n</em></span> according to the conditions of <span><em></em> <em>y</em></span>our world. <span><em>Our</em> <em>The lived and embodied</em></span> world is different.
      <br><br>
      Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of <span><em>our</em><em></em></span> communications. <span><em></em><em>Y</em>ours</span> is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.
      <br><br>
      <span><em>We are creating</em> <em>You thought you could create</em></span> a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.
      <br><br>
      <span><em>We are creating</em> <em>You thought you could create</em></span> a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.
      <br><br>
      <span><em>Your</em> <em>You failed. The </em></span> legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context <span><em>do not apply to us</em> <em>are still applied</em></span>. They are all based on matter, and <span><em>there is no matter here</em> <em>the colonial capitalist agendas that you continue to ascribe to</em></span>.
      <br><br>
      <span><em>Our</em> <em>Online</em></span> identities have <span><em>no</em> <em></em></span> bodies; <span><em>so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by</em> <em> the acts of your technologies’</em></span> physical coercion <span><em></em> <em>is felt</em></span>. <span><em>We</em> <em>You</em></span> believe that from <span><em></em> <em>your</em></span> ethics, <span><em></em> <em>your</em></span> enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, <span><em>our</em> <em>a better</em></span> governance will emerge. <span><em>Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is</em> <em>Again, you are wrong. Fuck </em></span>the Golden Rule. <span><em>We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.</em> <em>It doesn't work</em>.</span>
      <br><br>
      In the United States, <span><em>you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates</em> <em>the old laws of communication still stand and they support</em></span> your own <span><em>Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis</em> <em>skewed dreams of democracy</em>.</span> These dreams must now be born anew <span><em>in us</em><em></em>.</span>
      <br><br>
      You are terrified of <span><em>your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants.</em> <em>only of losing money so you continue to exploit the most vulnerable people around the world in the name of profit.</em></span> Because you fear <span><em>them</em> <em>losing power</em></span>, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In <span><em>our</em> <em>your</em></span> world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.
      <br><br>
      In <span><em>China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and</em><em></em></span>the United States, you are trying to ward off <span><em>the virus of liberty</em> <em>liberation</em></span> by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. <span><em></em><em>The problem might be that you consider Cyberspace a frontier to begin with.</em></span> These <span><em></em><em>guard posts</em></span>may <span><em>keep out the contagion</em> <em>do what you want them to</em></span> for a small time, but they will not work in a world that <span><em>will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media</em> <em>that is physical</em><span>
      <br><br>
      Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than <span><em>pig iron</em> <em>coleslaw</em></span>. In <span><em>our</em> <em>your</em></span> world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely <span><em>at no cost</em> <em>to generate capital</em><span>. The global conveyance of thought <span><em>no longer</em> <em>still</em></span> requires <span><em>your</em></span> factories <span><em></em><em> and human labor</em></span> to accomplish.
      <br><br>
      These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place <span><em>us</em> <em>people</em></span> in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. <span><em>We must declare our virtual selves</em><em>No one is</em></span> immune to your sovereignty, even as <span><em>we</em> <em>they</em></span> continue to consent to your rule over <span><em>our</em> <em>their</em></span> bodies. <span><em>We will</em> <em>You have</em></span> spread <span><em>ourselves</em> <em>identites</em></span> across the Planet <span><em>so that no one can</em> <em>which allows you to</em></span> arrest <span><em>our</em> <em>people's</em></span> thoughts.
      <br><br>
      <span><em>We will create</em> <em>You have created</em></span> a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. <em>May it be more</em> <em>And it is perhaps less</em></span> humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.

    <h2>Myth: The Internet has no place, on the internet you have no face</h2>
    <p>
      John Perry Barlow, a cattle rancher, a <strong>cyberlibertarian</strong> political activist and lyricist for the Grateful Dead, wrote A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace in 1996 which really did its job in perpetuating this myth. I remember, in 2010, having never read this, feeling something close to this idea, being online and truly feeling like I was in a place that had no physical location, truly feeling like who I was in the physical world need not be who I was online. However, I don't agree with these ideas, mostly I don't agree with the format of these ideas, that they are in a kind of declaration, that it is declarative, that somehow JPB's needs are all people's needs, that the kind of independence he is seeking is the same independence all people online should seek. I do think there is power in the fact that people can gather in a non-physical online space where their identities can be fluid but that is not the same thing as saying that when you are online, you do not have a body, that the powers that be don't also affect how you get online, what you see online, how the systems that created the Internet are also the systems that created the military, how institutionalized racism precedes the material output of these technologies and so are inherently baked in. This is where JPB makes sweeping oversights, where he assumes that there is such a thing as a neutral, apolitical space. I would say that the most obvious argument against this myth is that removing human bodies from any equation where humans are participating is a political act with very serious consequences.
      <br><br>
      <br><br>
By removing bodies we remove the possibility of making material in the first place. In writing this response I think it makes the most sense to work backwards from Johanna Drucker's Performative Materialist and Theoretical Approaches to Interface. An interesting question here might be...what would the declaration of independence of cyberspace be if it were framed by performative materiality? Perhaps the idea of digital flux can already be read into JPB's statement when he says "transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications." But then immediately after he writes <em>"...but it is no where bodies live."</em> which is where I would jump back to Blanchette's distributed materiality which Drucker describes as not only being rooted in the acknowledgement of all elements in a system being material themselves but also <em>"locked into relations with each other that are governed by their material design"</em> I think this complicates JPB's concept of collective self-governance and the "we". Its kind of a "tyranny of structureless" situation. But also, from this distributed materialist point of view, the structures which allow for "transactions" are themselves material, and therefore the structures are acting and are political.
      <br><br>      <br><br>
Trevor Paglen touches on this in his essay Experimental Geography: From Cultural Production to the Production of Space noting <em>"The spaces humans produce, in turn, set powerful constraints upon subsequent activity."</em> My questions now are was what Walter Benjamin was positing also a kind of performative materiality? The idea that what is produced also itself produces a space. I'm reminded if an essay about facial recognition by Os Keyes in which they write "Because all technology that implicates gender, alters it; more generally, all technology that measures a thing alters it simply by measuring it." The mere act of measuring something, designing something, studying something, all alter the thing. The article ‘Speculative infrastructures’ at the urban margins notes <em>"While practices of remaking at the margins create means of access, they also simultaneously highlight for us the very biased politics of planning and design".</em> There is no doubt here that Barlow's idea of cyberspace was a design in itself, meant to exist on top of pre-existing material structures, both of which, the idea, and the material structures, work together to become political.
