    <h2>Myth: The Genius Founder</h2>
    <p>
      What strikes me is that none of the men who have "innovated" platforms from their "genius" have ever <em>risen</em> to the occasion of anything regarding their users’ collective concerns. Perhaps this is because there are no collective concerns? At least when Zuckerberg did those hearings it always seemed like he was on the defense, yes and no answers to questions, not necessarily taking accountability for how his platform might have harmful effects. These "genius founders", like Steve Jobs, have simply been boosted by their ability to work with computers, the money that followed, and now governments and institutions of great power. They hold on to their platforms tightly as more and more people join them. Perhaps they believe their power to be justified since we all somewhat willingly join only to realize that everything that we do belongs in the end to them.
<br><br>
      I am thinking about genius founders as the people who have created something which became much bigger than them and was easily put into the hands of people on a hyper-scale. Often these founders are finding problems that their innovations can solve after the fact. For example, Mark Zuckerberg. I guess there's also such a thing as a "genius organizer" which Tiana Reid points out when discussing how Astra Taylor taps into this "singular dude" myth. Taylor recounts a quote from Martin Luther King: " “No, movements need a leader.” They go on to discuss how this is the antithesis to Ella Baker's style of organizing in which movements are leaderless and the core mission of the movement is energized by the collective.
<br><br>
      I supposed I'm tripped up a little on some of the thinking around these readings because I keep flip-flopping between platforms, where so much power lies, and movements. I guess I'm wondering do these platforms need movements to move against them. Perhaps movements work best when they are by people for people, regardless of offline or online injustice. I suppose what I'm saying is that movements might need Ella Baker style organizing and platforms might need Mary Parker Follett style organizing. Or vice versa? Or both?
<br><br>
      A power-with platform like Facebook or Instagram sounds interesting. It occurs to me that this class is performing teacher-student “joint-thinking” and perhaps that is part of what makes it feel so different from other ITP classes where the motivation is to move fast, solve quickly, and go for individual ideas. Even collaboration can feel individual because unless there is a lot of work put into dissolving the imbalance of power the process comes down to a power-over instead of a power-with way of working.

    <h2>An Acknowledgement of the Dependence of Cyberspace</h2>

      <br><br>
      You have not engaged in <span><em>our great</em> <em>any meaningful</em></span> and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of <span><em>our marketplaces</em> <em>peoples knowledge</em></span>.

      <br><br>
      You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, <span><em>we</em> <em>collectively people</em></span> will identify them and address them by <span><em>our</em> <em>their</em></span> means. <span><em>We are forming our</em> <em>You have formed your</em></span> own Social Contract. <span><em>This governance will</em> <em>This has all</em></span> arise<span><em></em><em>n</em></span> according to the conditions of <span><em></em> <em>y</em></span>our world. <span><em>Our</em> <em>The lived and embodied</em></span> world is different.
      <br><br>
      Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of <span><em>our</em><em></em></span> communications. <span><em></em><em>Y</em>ours</span> is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.
      <br><br>
      <span><em>We are creating</em> <em>You thought you could create</em></span> a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.
      <br><br>
      <span><em>We are creating</em> <em>You thought you could create</em></span> a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.
      <br><br>
      <span><em>Your</em> <em>You failed. The </em></span> legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context <span><em>do not apply to us</em> <em>are still applied</em></span>. They are all based on matter, and <span><em>there is no matter here</em> <em>the colonial capitalist agendas that you continue to ascribe to</em></span>.
      <br><br>
      <span><em>Our</em> <em>Online</em></span> identities have <span><em>no</em> <em></em></span> bodies; <span><em>so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by</em> <em> the acts of your technologies’</em></span> physical coercion <span><em></em> <em>is felt</em></span>. <span><em>We</em> <em>You</em></span> believe that from <span><em></em> <em>your</em></span> ethics, <span><em></em> <em>your</em></span> enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, <span><em>our</em> <em>a better</em></span> governance will emerge. <span><em>Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions.

      <br><br>
      In the United States, <span><em>you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates</em> <em>the old laws of communication still stand and they support</em></span> your own <span><em>Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis</em> <em>skewed dreams of democracy</em>.</span> These dreams must now be born anew <span><em>in us</em><em></em>.</span>
      <br><br>
      You are terrified of <span><em>your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants.</em> <em>only of losing money so you continue to exploit the most vulnerable people around the world in the name of profit.</em></span> Because you fear <span><em>them</em> <em>losing power</em></span>, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In <span><em>our</em> <em>your</em></span> world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. <span><em>We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.</em><em></em></span>
      <br><br>
      In <span><em>China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and</em> <em></em></span>the United States, you are trying to ward off <span><em>the virus of liberty</em> <em>liberation</em></span> by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. <span><em></em><em>The problem might be that you consider Cyberspace a frontier to begin with.</em></span> These <span><em></em> <em>guard posts</em></span> may <span><em>keep out the contagion</em> <em>do what you want them to</em></span> for a small time, but they will not work in a world that <span><em>will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media</em> <em>is the physical and lived world.</em></span>
      <br><br>
      Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than <span><em>pig iron</em> <em>coleslaw</em></span>. In <span><em>our</em> <em>your</em></span> world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely <span><em>at no cost</em> <em>to generate capital</em><span>. The global conveyance of thought <span><em>no longer</em> <em>still</em></span> requires <span><em>your</em></span> factories <span><em></em><em> and human labor</em></span> to accomplish.
      <br><br>
      These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place <span><em>us</em> <em>people</em></span> in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. <span><em>We must declare our virtual selves</em><em>No one is</em></span> immune to your sovereignty, even as <span><em>we</em> <em>they</em></span> continue to consent to your rule over <span><em>our</em> <em>their</em></span> bodies. <span><em>We will</em> <em>You have</em></span> spread <span><em>ourselves</em> <em>identites</em></span> across the Planet <span><em>so that no one can</em> <em>which allows you to</em></span> arrest <span><em>our</em> <em>people's</em></span> thoughts.

    <h2>Myth: Everyone should be here: its better to be connected.</h2>
    <p>What is Mark Zuckerberg’s impetus for connecting everyone in the world? My hunch is that it’s to ensure some kind of panoptic eye so that he can keep the data brokerages, governments, and whatever other institutions he partners with happy. It was interesting to me how he wrote that the printing press and the television simply made communication more efficient. Not sure I agree here. I think they changed the way communication travels, what it looks like, what is or isn’t communicated but I would argue that communication between people can be just as efficient without these things.
    <br><br>Facebook most definitely changed the way we communicate. Maybe not Facebook but the Internet, email, chat. Facebook made a form of internet communication easy while exploiting the innate human need for social connection.  Why does Mark Zuckerberg’s want a more open culture? Reminds me of the right to opacity, the right to privacy. He doesn’t really acknowledge these perhaps because he assumes that everything you do should be exposed which is an ideology that is rooted in violence. <br><br>Let us not forget that Facebook was originally called FaceSmash a place for to rate women Harvard students based on their hotness.
    <br><br>
    It’s interesting to think about Facebook as one big organization failing from the tyranny of structurelessness. Its tyranny is that there is a very large informal group of people (users) with a very clear power dynamic and a single leader. In this sense Facebook is an "elitist" group because only a few have immense power over many. This fact in itself should be enough to put people up in arms. The problem being that no one using Facebook has insight into its structure, no one has the power to change it. Is the problem then that we don’t even know what we want because we never knew we wanted something like Facebook in the first place?
    <br><br>
    I think if everyone needs to be connected to everyone else then there should be clearly defined and structured groups for doing so but these groups needs to be created by users themselves not by the few in power. This in the end would look like different kinds of connections (protocols?) between different people.

    <h2>Myth: The Internet has no place, on the internet you have no face</h2>
    <p>
      John Perry Barlow, a cattle rancher, a <strong>cyberlibertarian</strong> political activist and lyricist for the Grateful Dead, wrote A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace in 1996 which really did its job in perpetuating this myth. I remember, in 2010, having never read this, feeling something close to this idea, being online and truly feeling like I was in a place that had no physical location, truly feeling like who I was in the physical world need not be who I was online. However, I don't agree with these ideas, mostly I don't agree with the format of these ideas, that they are in a kind of declaration, that it is declarative, that somehow JPB's needs are all people's needs, that the kind of independence he is seeking is the same independence all people online should seek. I do think there is power in the fact that people can gather in a non-physical online space where their identities can be fluid but that is not the same thing as saying that when you are online, you do not have a body, that the powers that be don't also affect how you get online, what you see online, how the systems that created the Internet are also the systems that created the military, how institutionalized racism precedes the material output of these technologies and so are inherently baked in. This is where JPB makes sweeping oversights, where he assumes that there is such a thing as a neutral, apolitical space. I would say that the most obvious argument against this myth is that removing human bodies from any equation where humans are participating is a political act with very serious consequences.
      <br><br>
      <br><br>
By removing bodies we remove the possibility of making material in the first place. In writing this response I think it makes the most sense to work backwards from Johanna Drucker's Performative Materialist and Theoretical Approaches to Interface. An interesting question here might be...what would the declaration of independence of cyberspace be if it were framed by performative materiality? Perhaps the idea of digital flux can already be read into JPB's statement when he says "transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications." But then immediately after he writes <em>"...but it is no where bodies live."</em> which is where I would jump back to Blanchette's distributed materiality which Drucker describes as not only being rooted in the acknowledgement of all elements in a system being material themselves but also <em>"locked into relations with each other that are governed by their material design"</em> I think this complicates JPB's concept of collective self-governance and the "we". Its kind of a "tyranny of structureless" situation. But also, from this distributed materialist point of view, the structures which allow for "transactions" are themselves material, and therefore the structures are acting and are political.
      <br><br>      <br><br>
Trevor Paglen touches on this in his essay Experimental Geography: From Cultural Production to the Production of Space noting <em>"The spaces humans produce, in turn, set powerful constraints upon subsequent activity."</em> My questions now are was what Walter Benjamin was positing also a kind of performative materiality? The idea that what is produced also itself produces a space. I'm reminded if an essay about facial recognition by Os Keyes in which they write "Because all technology that implicates gender, alters it; more generally, all technology that measures a thing alters it simply by measuring it." The mere act of measuring something, designing something, studying something, all alter the thing. The article ‘Speculative infrastructures’ at the urban margins notes <em>"While practices of remaking at the margins create means of access, they also simultaneously highlight for us the very biased politics of planning and design".</em> There is no doubt here that Barlow's idea of cyberspace was a design in itself, meant to exist on top of pre-existing material structures, both of which, the idea, and the material structures, work together to become political.
