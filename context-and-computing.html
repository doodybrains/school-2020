    <h2>Myth: The Internet has no place, on the internet you have no face</h2>
    <p>
      John Perry Barlow, a cattle rancher, a <strong>cyberlibertarian</strong> political activist and lyricist for the Grateful Dead, wrote A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace in 1996 which really did its job in perpetuating this myth. I remember, in 2010, having never read this, feeling something close to this idea, being online and truly feeling like I was in a place that had no physical location, truly feeling like who I was in the physical world need not be who I was online. However, I don't agree with these ideas, mostly I don't agree with the format of these ideas, that they are in a kind of declaration, that it is declarative, that somehow JPB's needs are all people's needs, that the kind of independence he is seeking is the same independence all people online should seek. I do think there is power in the fact that people can gather in a non-physical online space where their identities can be fluid but that is not the same thing as saying that when you are online, you do not have a body, that the powers that be don't also affect how you get online, what you see online, how the systems that created the Internet are also the systems that created the military, how institutionalized racism <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/bbcG7e2dBj0">precedes the material output of these technologies</a> and so are inherently baked in. This is where JPB makes sweeping oversights, where he assumes that there is such a thing as a neutral, apolitical space. I would say that the most obvious argument against this myth is that removing human bodies from any equation where humans are participating is a political act with very serious consequences.

      By removing bodies we remove the possibility of making material in the first place. In writing this response I think it makes the most sense to work backwards from Johanna Drucker's Performative Materialist and Theoretical Approaches to Interface. An interesting question here might be...what would the declaration of independence of cyberspace be if it were framed by performative materiality? Perhap's the idea of <strong>digital flux</strong> can already be read into JPB's statement when he says <em>"transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communicatons."</em> But then immediately after he writes "...but it is no where bodies live." which is where I would jump back to Blanchette's <strong>distributed materiality</strong> which Drucker describes as not only being rooted in the acknowledgement of all elements in a system being material themselves but also <em>"locked into relations with each other that are goverened by their material design"</em>. I think this complicates JPB's concept of collective self-governance and the "we". Its kind of a "tyranny of structureless" situation. But also, from this distributed materialist point of view, the structures which allow for "transactions" are themselves material, and therefore the structures are acting and are political.

      Trevor Paglen touches on this in his essay Experimental Geography: From Cultural Production to the Production of Space noting "The spaces humans produce, in turn, set powerful constraints upon subsequent activity." My qustions now are was what Walter Benjamin was positing also a kind of performative materiality? The idea that what is produced also itself produces a space. I'm reminded if an essay about facial recognition by Os Keyes in which they write "". The article ‘Speculative infrastructures’ at the urban margins writes "While practices of remaking at the margins create means of access, they also simultaneously highlight for us the very biased politics of planning and design"
There is no doubt here that Barlow's idea of cyberspace was a design in itself, meant to exist on top of pre-existing material structures, both of which, the idea, and the material structures, work together to become political.
