    <h1>computer mouse research</h1>

    <h2>mouse as mediator, thinking through new organology</h2>
    <p>
      this semester i have reading gilbert simondon, who is considered one of the earlier philosophers of technology. his provocation is that there isn't a true philosophy of technological objects and therefore there is a large gap between technics and humans. as in technology is either viewed as a threat or as something which we have complete command over, that there is perhaps no living alongside machines. so i'm interested in the question "how do find ourselves among machine"
    </p>

    <p>
      after doing extended research on the history of the computer mouse, how gender and labor have been shifted, divided, and been enacted through it, i think i'm always veering away from the mouse only to be brought right back to it. the most interesting questions to me now regarding the mouse itself, the mouse as an actor, the mouse as a handshake, the mouse as a technological object which creates and is created by infrastructures, systems, ideologies.

      i think it might be interesting to think through the mouse the way that Don Buchla thought through the keyboard:
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      “A keyboard is dictatorial,” he argued. “When you’ve got a black and white keyboard there it’s hard to play anything but keyboard music. And when there’s not a black and white keyboard you get into the knobs and the wires and the interconnections and the timbres, and you get involved in many other aspects of the music, and it’s a far more experimental way.”
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      the questions for me now are, what is the mouse as a technical object? what role does it play in what ensemble? does its study belong to "organology"? how is it always already helping humans connect not to eachother but to computers? what might relationships to computers look like without the mouse? what are the computer mouse's ethics? thinking through Tresch and Dolan's new organology, what is the mouses material disposition, what is its mode of mediation, what larger ensemble is it a part of? what is its telos? its ends? its goals? so many of these questions are also framed by simondon.

    <em>what else is out there like it</em>
    <em>how is yours different?</em>
    <em>how does it improve what exists?</em>
    <em>what audience is it for?</em>
    <em>what is the world/context/ market that your project lives in?</em>
    <em>have you found something you didn’t expect?</em>

    <h2>mouse as an interdisciplinary point of entry</h2>
    <p>
      whenever i feel that i have exhausted all of the possible research that i could on the mouse i meet some kind of new question. i thought i was at this point until the computer mouse conference. the event raised so many new questions for me but the most striking one was the kind of possibilities for interdisciplinary conversation through the mouse. what has always been clear is that imploding the computer mouse is generative. the conference brought together conversations on labor, economies, machine/body relationships, queer dimensions, maintenance, speculative fiction, calibration, gender, networked desire, and personal histories. there was so much excitement and knowledge in the room it got me thinking about the deep need for open conversations around history of technolgy and how to live with technology. how the mouse is this really accessible cultural object which everyone who has ever used a computer had some kind of relationship to.
      <br><br>
      my own research on the mouse was leading me towards questions of womens labor in the global computing assembly line, manufacturing of computing and its effect on the body, current technology/research initiatives led by women, the possibility of women bookending the mess of large scale computation. i think the mouse was just my entry point into this research. and its occuring to me now that the mouse is powerful as an entry point. what does it mean to be powerful as an entry point. is that something worth thinking more deeply about?
      <br><br>
      i wonder if the mouse should also be my exit point? there is some extremely thorough research on women's labor in the manufacturing of computing technologies by Aiwa Ong and Donna Haraway to name two. Perhaps its meaningful then to root the research into the computer mouse. Lucie Vagnerova did something similar in writing about the production of electronic music technologies.
      <br><br>
      im thinking about its possibility for interdisciplinarity, the possiblity for asking meaninful questions of technology's location in the world, the possibility for generative and cross-disciplinary conversation.
