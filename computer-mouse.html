    <h1>computer mouse research</h1>
    <h2>one minute proposal</h2>
    <p>
      for the past year i have been thinking with and through the computer mouse. in step with the mouse, i have co-organized a conference, published an essay, re-purposed old mice for new uses, and am currently finishing a long form research paper on the mouse as a technological object. in doing all of this i have also compiled many smaller mouse projects and threads of research relating but not limited to the study of the history of technology and its intersections with theories on labor, gender, infrastructure, and environmental systems. my intention for thesis is to organize all of this work into a self-published book which seeks to take the computer mouse on its own terms. the only formal decision that i have made about the book is that it will double in function as a mouse pad.

    <h2>theorizing the computer mouse</h2>
    <p>
      <em>If You Give a Mouse Gilbert Simondon</em>
      <br><br>
      This paper will lean on Gilbert Simondon’s philosophy of technology in asking questions of the computer mouse as a technological object. The primary question, what can the computer mouse tell us about the chasm between technical inputs and outputs be they computational or social? How does one create and get created by the other? I would also like to lean on the work of Elizabeth Grosz, Yuk Hui, and Sadie Plant.
      <br><br>
      <em>Introduction</em>
      First, I will define the computer mouse and write a small history of its coming into being. What is the computer mouse? What does it do? Where was it invented? Why? How was its significance changed? What came before it? What is coming after it? Where are they made? Who is involved?
      <br><br>
      <em>Part I</em>
      Then I will consider how this history can be re-imagined without a sole inventor, Douglas Engelbart. How can the invention of the mouse be re-read through ontogenesis? Or maybe through its individuation? In step with Simondon, if it was not invented, but rather it emerged, from what did it emerge? Is this a form/matter figure/ground question? How did the form of the mouse become itself?
      <br><br>
      In concluding Part I the hope is to have new questions about the pre-history of the mouse which might inform questions about a post-mouse “culture”.
      <br><br>
      <em>Part II</em>
      In this section I will rise to Simondon’s challenge to take a technological object on its own. First I will definite the mouse in Simondons terms of element, individual, ensemble,
      <br><br>
      What is its ensemble, how is it in this ensemble? The question of ensemble is also the question of element, individual. Is the mouse just an element? Does its ensemble pre-date its individuation? Is its ensemble moving? Has it shifted?
      <br><br>
      To close this section my provocations will be: is possible to de-anthropomorphize the mouse? To look at it as an acting object with agency. And if we were to do this, to what end?
      <br><br>
      <em>Part III</em>
      In this final section I will consider the mouse and its relationship to production in order to illuminate Simondons notions of alienation.
      <br><br>
      How does the mouse alienate us from the work we do with it? How does it alienate us from computers? How is the mouse itself alienated?
      <br><br>
      The purpose of this section is questionable, but I think it might be helpful in the task of taking the mouse on its own terms.
      <br><br>
      <em>Part IV</em>
      My thesis question for this paper is how the mouse mediates between inputs and outputs. The mouse is itself an input and an output. It produces and is produced. It might be the aesthetic object, a key point, between culture and technics. I think what I want to do here is subvert this culture/technics debate with an input/output debate. To understand the two as needing each-other and influencing each-other and then to get in between them I feel is a more current debate to be taken up. How does the technical become social and how can the social be understood technical? What is social input and technical output?  What is technical input and social output? Perhaps this analysis can also take up gender theory? What is an object that is both and input and an output? Queering of the mouse. How does the mouse mediate between the technical and social? Is this where the mouse’s genesis is?
      <br><br>
      <em>Conclusion</em>
      Can the mouse be understood as a nonhuman actor at intersection of nature/culture/technics? How can addressing the mouse in this way produce new questions about our current technological moment? In step with Simondon, how can taking the mouse on its own terms help us understand, create, and work with computers, have them as entities between us, as opposed to below us or above us, in control or under the control of them.

    <h2>mouse as mediator, thinking through new organology</h2>
    <p>
      this semester i have reading gilbert simondon, who is considered one of the earlier philosophers of technology. his provocation is that there isn't a true philosophy of technological objects and therefore there is a large gap between technics and humans. as in technology is either viewed as a threat or as something which we have complete command over, that there is perhaps no living alongside machines. so i'm interested in the question "how do find ourselves among machine"
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      after doing extended research on the history of the computer mouse, how gender and labor have been shifted, divided, and been enacted through it, i think i'm always veering away from the mouse only to be brought right back to it. the most interesting questions to me now regarding the mouse itself, the mouse as an actor, the mouse as a handshake, the mouse as a technological object which creates and is created by infrastructures, systems, ideologies.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      i think it might be interesting to think through the mouse the way that Don Buchla thought through the keyboard:
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      “A keyboard is dictatorial,” he argued. “When you’ve got a black and white keyboard there it’s hard to play anything but keyboard music. And when there’s not a black and white keyboard you get into the knobs and the wires and the interconnections and the timbres, and you get involved in many other aspects of the music, and it’s a far more experimental way.”
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      the questions for me now are, what is the mouse as a technical object? what role does it play in what ensemble? does its study belong to "organology"? how is it always already helping humans connect not to eachother but to computers? what might relationships to computers look like without the mouse? what are the computer mouse's ethics? thinking through Tresch and Dolan's new organology, what is the mouses material disposition, what is its mode of mediation, what larger ensemble is it a part of? what is its telos? its ends? its goals? so many of these questions are also framed by simondon.
    </p>

    <em>what else is out there like it</em>
    <em>how is yours different?</em>
    <em>how does it improve what exists?</em>
    <em>what audience is it for?</em>
    <em>what is the world/context/ market that your project lives in?</em>
    <em>have you found something you didn’t expect?</em>

    <h2>mouse as an interdisciplinary point of entry</h2>
    <p>
      whenever i feel that i have exhausted all of the possible research that i could on the mouse i meet some kind of new question. i thought i was at this point until the computer mouse conference. the event raised so many new questions for me but the most striking one was the kind of possibilities for interdisciplinary conversation through the mouse. what has always been clear is that imploding the computer mouse is generative. the conference brought together conversations on labor, economies, machine/body relationships, queer dimensions, maintenance, speculative fiction, calibration, gender, networked desire, and personal histories. there was so much excitement and knowledge in the room it got me thinking about the deep need for open conversations around history of technolgy and how to live with technology. how the mouse is this really accessible cultural object which everyone who has ever used a computer had some kind of relationship to.
      <br><br>
      my own research on the mouse was leading me towards questions of womens labor in the global computing assembly line, manufacturing of computing and its effect on the body, current technology/research initiatives led by women, the possibility of women bookending the mess of large scale computation. i think the mouse was just my entry point into this research. and its occuring to me now that the mouse is powerful as an entry point. what does it mean to be powerful as an entry point. is that something worth thinking more deeply about?
      <br><br>
      i wonder if the mouse should also be my exit point? there is some extremely thorough research on women's labor in the manufacturing of computing technologies by Aiwa Ong and Donna Haraway to name two. Perhaps its meaningful then to root the research into the computer mouse. Lucie Vagnerova did something similar in writing about the production of electronic music technologies.
      <br><br>
      im thinking about its possibility for interdisciplinarity, the possiblity for asking meaninful questions of technology's location in the world, the possibility for generative and cross-disciplinary conversation.

    <h2>beginning to question the computer mouse</h2>
    <p>
      <em>The importance of a philosophy of the computer mouse.</em>By this I mean, what value can be added to the computer mouse as a object which can be taken on its own. What would it mean to study the mouse as an ontological object. How might understanding its position in the world, how it creates and is created by, help to understand its surrounding environments, networks, actors?
      <br><br>
      <em>Mouse as a technological object.</em> I mean this in the Simondonian sense. That the mouse is an object which can and should be taken on its own terms. How to divorce it, for the purpose of questioning it, from the computer, the gui, the human? What is the evolution of the mouse? Where is its genesis?
      <br><br>
      <em>Mouse as an aesthetic object mediating between technics and social.</em>What about the mouses's shape and material and look and feel tells us about it situatedness? How does it mediate between the larger social world around it and the technical world inside of it?
      <br><br>
      <em>Mouse as creating and being created by technics and social.</em>How are both the social world outside and technical world inside reversed to create eachother? In other words, how does the technical world create the social world outside the mouse and how does the social work create the technical world inside the mouse? And what of this interior/exterior dichotomy?
      <br><br>
      <em>What is the mouse without a computer?</em>I'm just interested in this question.
      <br><br>
      <em>What is the mouse’s ensemble?</em>What is the ensemble that has been created by the mouse alone. The personal computer for sure. The GUI for sure. What else?
      <br><br>
      <em>Did the mouse contribute to a paradigm shift or has it prevented us from one all along?</em>
      <br><br>
      <em>What might have been possible without the mouse?</em>
      <br><br>
      <em>What is the mouse as an organological instrument?</em>How is its study organology? Just thinking about this as an approach!
