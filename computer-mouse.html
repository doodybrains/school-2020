    <h1>computer mouse research</h1>

    <h2>mouse as an interdisciplinary point of entry</h2>

    <p>
      whenever i feel that i have exhausted all of the possible research that i could on the mouse i meet some kind of new question. i thought i was at this point until the computer mouse conference. the event raised so many new questions for me but the most striking one was the kind of possibilities for interdisciplinary conversation through the mouse. what has always been clear is that imploding the computer mouse is generative. the conference brought together conversations on labor, economies, machine/body relationships, queer dimensions, maintenance, speculative fiction, calibration, gender, networked desire, and personal histories. there was so much excitement and knowledge in the room it got me thinking about the deep need for open conversations around history of technolgy and how to live with technology. how the mouse is this really accessible cultural object which everyone who has ever used a computer had some kind of relationship to.
      <br><br>
      my own research on the mouse was leading me towards questions of womens labor in the global computing assembly line, manufacturing of computing and its effect on the body, current technology/research initiatives led by women, the possibility of women bookending the mess of large scale computation. i think the mouse was just my entry point into this research. and its occuring to me now that the mouse is powerful as an entry point. what does it mean to be powerful as an entry point. is that something worth thinking more deeply about?
      <br><br>
      im thinking about its possibility for interdisciplinarity, the possiblity for asking meaninful questions of technology's location in the world, the possibility for generative and cross-disciplinary conversation.
