    <h1>Electronics Lab</h1>
    <h2>week three</h2>
    <p>
      semiconductors ~ diodes, transistors, thyristos, themistors, phototransistors, lasers are all made with semiconductive materials
      <br><br>
      materials are classified by their ability to conduct electricity, semiconductors are those materials which have a neutral conductivity.
      <br><br>
      silicon is the most important semiconductor in building electrical devices, <strong>a cubic mile of seawater contains about 15,000 tons of silicon</strong> it is extremely rare to find silicon in its pure crystalline form in nature, and before it can be used, it must be separated from its binding elements. Once the silicon is "purified" it is spun unti a large "seed" crystal. It can then be cut off into wafers for use in devices.
      <br><br>
      silicon wafers cannot be used on their own, they need to be <em>doped</em> meaning other materials need to be added to it, like boron or phosphorus
      <br><br>
      a switch is a mechanical device that interrupts electric current flow within a circuit.
      <br><br>
      It is characterized by its number of poles and its number of throws.
      <br><br>
      Relays ~ electrically actuated switches.
      <br><br>
      Potentiometer > variable resistor > used to be called "volume controls", before this they were known as "rheostats" which means a device which sets the flow of current.
      <br><br>
      capacitance ~ measured in farads
    </p>

    <h2>week two</h2>
    <p>
      diode > is a material AND structural ? it is structurally built to be a semiconductive component w/o semiconductive material?
      <br><br>


    </p>



    <h2>week one</h2>
    <p>
      <em>notes from week one readings</em> <strong>current</strong>, notated as <em>I</em> is the totaly charge that passes through an area per a given unit of time and is measured in <em>amps</em>
      <br><br>
      current flow > conventional flow > "positive" charges > moving from postive to negative
      <br><br>
      100W lightbulb = 1 amp, toaster = 10 amps, LED 20 milliamps, lightning = 1000 amps
      <br><br>
      <strong>voltage</strong> needs to be present for an electrical current to move from point A to point B. voltage is also know as potential. voltage moves electrons from negative to positive creating Electro Motive Force or <strong>EMF</strong>. it moves electrons in a circuit from negative to positive <strong>positive to negative in conventional current flow</strong>
      <br><br>
      Volt = Watt / Amp
      <br><br>
      <em>1.5 Volt flashlight drawing 0.1 Amps uses .15 Watts of power</em>
      <br><br>
      1.5 V * 0.1 A = .15 W
      <br><br>
      <strong>resistance</strong> is the ratio of applied voltage divided by teh resulting current flow
      <br><br>
      R = V / I, V = I x R
      <br><br>
      wires have built in resistance (resistivity), the thinner the wire the more resistance

      labs are broken up into three sections:
      <strong>concepts</strong>
      <em>ohms law, etc.</em>
      <strong>components</strong>
      <em>passive vs active, resistor, transformer, etc.</em>
      <strong>tools for understanding components & concepts</strong>
      <em>oscilliscope, frequency counter etc.</em>
      <br><br>
      current electricity, generated by flow of electrical charge (not static)
      <br><br>
      alternating currents >> one alternates, one reverses directions, at a rate of 50 to 60 times per second, from positive to negative to postive to negative, squiggly line current, from 0 to 5 to 0
      <br><br>
      direct currents >> only goes from 0 to 5, dashed straight line current
      <br><br>
      current electricity >> most of the circuits will be DC circuits >> circuits that follows a single direction
      <br><br>
      apple charger, the brick that plugs into the wall is AC, the magnet is DC, the computer is also DC
      <br><br>
      building a flashlight >> battery, wire, lamp >> using a DC circuit, it follows a direction, current flows from positive to negative, what is actually moving is electrons which are moving from negative to positive, convential current flow (+ to -) uses <em>I</em>
      <br><br>
      pump analogy >> high pressure water, load decreases, low pressure water, pump pushes water back into high pressure
      <br><br>
      voltage (water pressure) is potential, current (how much water) is what is actually flowing
      <br><br>
      what is the difference between voltage and current? the voltage is the potential of electrons allowed, current is the amount of electrons
      <br><br>
      series circuit > current is the same but voltage is divded by amount of loads (for example 3 LEDS)
      <br><br>
      parallel circuit > voltage is the same but current is divded by amount of loads (for example 3 LEDS), all will have same brightness
      <br><br>
      battery circuit >> power to ground >> a.k.a. a short circuit >> connected by wires
      <br><br>
      wires can pass same amt of voltage but graded for different amount of current, more metal more current, higher the number the smaller the gage (less current, less awg)
      <br><br>
      current <em>I</em> is measured in on <em>amps</em>
      <br><br>
      gold as highly conductive >> some metals have more resistance than others >> recycled electronics >> gold
      <br><br>
      resistors as resisting the flow of electrons, measured in <em>ohms</em>
      carbon film used in diy electronics, through-hole easier for humans to solder, surface mount (flat, inside iphone) easier for robots to solder
      <br><br>
      resistor, first two to three places are place values, three or more is multiplier
      <br><br>
      get the adafruit resistor/circuit calculator!
      <br><br>
      mV > milivolts > low voltage
      <br><br>
      fixed resistor
      <br><br>
      variable resistor >> potentiometer, trimpot, rheostat
      <br><br>
      ohms law > finding relationship between resistance, voltage, and current
      <br><br>
      everything has tolerance and rating in electronics, for example LEDs are rated for particular voltages
      <em>V = I x R</em>
      6V battery, 2V + 20mA LED
      <br><br>
      <em>R = V / I</em>
      <br><br>
      <strong>R = (6 - 2) / 0.02</strong>
      <br><br>
      <strong> so Resistance is 200</strong>
      <br><br>
      5V, RED LED, Resistor, GROUND
      <br><br>
      <strong>2 resistor circuit ~ voltage divider</strong>
      <br><br>
      10k resistor, 10k resistor, 5V gets transformed into 2.5V
      <br><br>
      9k resistor, 1k resistor, 5V gets transformed into 4.5V
      <br><br>
      variable resistor can be used to measure voltage
      <br><br>

      <br><br>
      falstad.com/circuit/e-index.html
      <br><br>
      capacitor as water tank, battery as water pump
