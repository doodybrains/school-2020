    <h1>Designing The Post Natural</h1>

    <p>
      thinking about the iNaturalist approach to labeling images with computer vision software in order to then label species in larger data sets of species created by humans. how the computer and human are working together here in order to label. how labeling erodes agency from whatever is being labeled. whats really happening is that computers held by humans are working with computers held by institutions and together those computers are generating another computer which retroactively tells the computers belonging to humans and institutions what to do.
      <br><br>
      reading Kyle Stine's <em>Critical Hardware: The Circuit of Image and Data</em> and Allan Sekula's <em>The Body and the Archive</em>
      <br><br>
      in his paper, Kline argues that computation is always already a visual medium. although its is often a given that the interface is built and understood visually for most people, it is also thought that the inner workings of computation are not visual but electrical and mathmatical. Kline disagrees here by noting that since the invention of the circuit fabrication the act of fabricating computers has used photolithographic processes to create integrated circuits. so without the invention of photography, we would not have the production of the integrated circuit.
      <br><br>
      Sekula, in writing about the invention of photography and its early use for portraiture, notes that <strong>"every portrait implicity took its place within a social and moral hierarchy"</strong> the subject turned object was either looking up, to a "superior", or down to somone "inferior"
      <br><br>
      Should images of and made by microchips be analyzed similarly in that they create and fold in to the systems which create them and which they proliferate? If a microchip is making decisions about someones gender, then the microchip can be compared to the camera, and not the camera itself, but who is making the image, who is the subject turned object, in which direction is the microchip looking?
      <br><br>
      Another quote from Sekula, which I think could be read through the philosophy of Gilbert Simondon: <strong>"The camera is integrated into a larger ensemble: a bureaucratic-clerical-statistical system of "intelligence." This system can be described as sophisticated form of the archive. The central artifact of this system is not camera but the filing cabinet."</strong> This led me to Shannon Mattern's <em>Bureaucracy's Playthings</em> in which she discusses the aesthetics of filing.
      <br><br>
      what strikes me now is that we don't really have a moral compass for microchips themselves. they often just are. is that because they're invisible? is it because they're non biological? is it because they're not "masters" or "tools" but compact objects which unfold into larger systems? can computers look at portraits of microchips the same way that we might look at portraits of people? from a far? from a particular place in a social hierarchy?

    <h2>clock</h2>
    <div class="images lg">

    </div>
    <p>
      thinking about this clock project. i am going to take a screen shot every minute on the minute for the next hour. It is currently 2pm. When I end it will be 3pm. This piece is meant to be in conversation with Teching Hseih's piece "One Year Performance: Time Clock". He took a photo every hour on the hour from April 11, 1980 to April 11, 1981. Teching has spoken about the non-boundary between his art and his life. I often feel like that between my life and my work and my art because all of it is on the computer. this is kind of an endurance piece in and of itself i think because it has become harder for me given all of the distractions on my computer to stay focused on writing this text, about my experience of paying attention to the minute, in a sense staying present. its not nearly the amount of endurance that teching had but i think it kind of speaks to how much time has been compressed and sped up by ubiquitous networked computing. how the clock has become kind of invisible. how labor while still very much present in the material sense has become immaterial. how im always and already working once i open my computer. if i like something, click on something, open something, it is potentially all creating profit for someone somewhere. I can't remember where I read this, I think in the John Durham Peters piece. Something about clocks always being concerned with the day and everything below. Calendars being concerned with the day and everything above, the week, the month etc. Its interesting to me I guess that clocks are always ticking, especially the ones inside our computers. There's just a constantly oscillting crystal which I believe runs on a battery? Confirmed, it runs off of the motherboard's battery. I also learned that the Network Time Protocol is one of the earliest and longest running protocols in use. It basically ensures that your computer, once connected to the internet, is going through a series of nodes which are all connected to UTC. As they connect to each node they are updating their time against the UTC time. What I found interesting during this process is that manually updating the time to a past time is a security risk. Keep time synchronized across computing devices is essential to their working.<strong>The UTC second has been defined by the 13th General Conference of Weights and Measures in 1967 as "The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom."</strong> When I check my computer's time against network time is often fractions of seconds off. The fraction is so small that I guess it makes no difference in my computer's ability to communicate with other computers but I am left wondering how much of a difference there is and to what effect that difference is and how that difference is made. Got distracted. Going back to Teching's work. I guess I still have questions about his work. There's something uncomfortable about clocking in at all hours of the day and night for a whole year. What is he doing before and after the hour ? Clocks keep up beholden to work. Even when I'm not working the anxiety of the clock becomes the anxiety of work. The clock's hand is pulling me through time, pulling me through work. This is maybe why it sometimes difficult to be on someone else's clock because not only is the clock pulling you forward but that person's version of the clock is pulling you forward. Could it be argued that we were all already following the Network Time Protocol? That we're always checking in against some larger clock, the clock in Teching's piece, the factory clock, the school clock, that our internet notions of this particular kind of time are always updating against the larger clocks that drive people and machines and the things in and around them into the future time? I really like this term "clock drift". As in the clock is something that is always moving in some direction, irregardless of the things that are trying to control it, and it will continue to drift, aimlessly, until something or someone comes in to update it. I'd be curious to watch my computer's clock drift in "real time". Also learning about "bit slip" where bits are lost or gained due to clock drift. Timing attacks! Some password checking systems rely on linear checks, where the first letter is checked then the second letter and so on. If the first letter is correct then the check is extremely fast because it didn't have to compare any more first letters against the correct letter. I'm not so clear yet on how these actually work but it seems that if you can exploit the amount of time it takes a request from the browser to receive information from a server then you are able to collect potentially confidential data based on that time. I suppose it would be interesting to try this project again, on the hour, for an entire day. I would be interested to know how much longer I hang around my computer for. What it means to always be going to my computer to clock in. I'm wondering now how important the body is the Hseih's work. How so much of what was required of his piece was the ability of his body. To get out of bed, to get to the place where his camera was, the stand there and take the photo irregardless of where is body was, how it felt, etc etc. I've been thinking a lot about how computers erase bodies, how my laptop truly does not care about my body, how uncomfortable it is to use it, how only my hands and my eyes are required and how this 2019 gesture at Hseih's 1980 piece is really a gesture towards the compression of time, the act of paying attention, how labor becomes immaterial. Hmm. Something else that interests me in Hseih's work is the timelessness of it. The media is probably the only telling thing. The fact that it was shot on 16mm film. How I suppose that thew documentation of this work is made with screenshots and HTML on a laptop might be telling of it being made in 2019. How otherwise the piece exists as independent of time although that particular kind of punch clock is also telling of factory work and that perhaps is the most important talking point in the piece. It's 3:00pm on October 23rd, 2019 and I'm watching a WPIX news hour on April 11, 1980!

      <em>proposal ideas:</em> the clock, for me, has been a symbol for hyper-productivity. always racing the clock. which is why this weeks readings were kind of cathartic in that a clock can take many forms, affect and be affected by many things, but in the end it is always going. while i am on my computer i am always feeling that time is slipping away from. my time becomes computer time and computer time becomes my time. i would like to be in conversation with Tehching Hsieh for this assignment. also, thinking about what John Durham Peters said of the difference between clocks and calendars being their relationship to the day. what it would it mean to have to click a button, point to a clock, click on a clock and your computer took a picture of you, every minute for a full day. i haven't done too much research yet on Hsieh's piece but i'm curious about why he took the pictures, why he chose one year, why he chose the hour.
      <br><br>
      another thing im thinking about is to create a dropdown in the os or the browser which allows you to choose a "screen saver" from a set of options. Not "After 30 minutes" but "After I visit Facebook 30 times". the challenging part will be to set this apart from the every day app which monitors your "productivity" or locks down your phone after using social media.

      Peters is marking differences between the calendar and the clock, the clock face as a non-arbitrary shape, rooted in the shape of the earth, as corresponding to direction and celestial bodies, calendars start with the day and expand upwards, clocks start with the day and expand downwards, but what is a <em>day</em>?

      while Robert Marshum's annual recordings found that change such as tempurature increased with time, it is hard to notice this increase or change within one generation. in the example of the caribou, because of warming oceans the spring is starting earlier meaning that plants are well on their way to growing before the caribou migrate back to them from the edge of the sea. by the time they get to them the plants have already lost a signifigant amount of nutrients. this is not only a <strong>trophic mismatch</strong> in which one species cannot count on another species for food survival, but also a <strong>phenological mismatch</strong> where one species is operating on a different clock due to shifting environmental conditions.

      the real transation of instagram as being emotional. as you having a certain feeling when choosing a filter, or i would argue, choosing which photo to post, of being an artist, feeling agency because you are choosing, feeling emotional because you are sharing something that is yours, close to you in some way, with "the world". Bridle is arguing that Instagram's most effective feature is its algorithmic timeline. <strong>"The algorithmic timeline is a deliberate phenological mismatch, reordering the flow of time itself to maximize the action/reward loop."</strong> the internet at large, facebook, google, etc will also experience phenological mismatch: "Increasing humidity and rainfall will change the refractive index of the atmosphere, leading to problems with microwave transmission and wi-fi propagation. Rising sea levels will overrun the beaches where cables come ashore and ever more frequent superstorms will make the repair and upkeep of long distance cable networks impossible."

      I feel a bit allergic to sensors in general. Who needs another sensor? Everything is already being sensored. There is an obvious argument here which is what <em>isn't</em> being captured and why.
      <br><br>
      I went to see Shannon Mattern talk at Columbia's GSAPP program. The talk was titled "Mapwashing: Co-Opting and Reclaiming Civic Design". It was interesting to be in a room of architecture / design students discussing big tech and the implications of geospatial mapping, data collection, and neoliberal urbanism, where cities emerge according to capitalistic power. Some things that I am still thinking about are the co-opting of a kind of inherent aesthetic of community planning, the illusion of community engagement in large corporate projects, and how maps can be much less evident of place than local data, community-built archives and oral histories, and how maps can also be so much more than just points and perimeters.
      <br><br>
      The talk got me thinking more deeply about my relationship to physical space through digital maps. How often I look at Google maps before I leave my house if I'm going to midtown or a neighborhood that I don't usually spend time in. How I quickly scroll and drag my cursor between subway stops and coffee shops so that I can make sure I know where everything is when I get there. How sometimes I make the choice of not looking at a map so that I can happen upon somewhere without preconception and how this makes me feel more connected to that place, how I more easily remember how I got there and what's around it.
      <br><br>
      I think a lot about the <em>computer mouse</em>, its history, its teleology, in the context of this course I'm thinking about its potential to be used without a GUI.
      <br><br>
      Initial ideas: I would like to place a mouse in a physical space. Lets say the Brooklyn Heights Promenade (where my arts of noticing project is taking place). The signage near the mouse will instruct whoever is using the mouse to scroll the wheel until they arrive at a certain place, lets say the other side of the East River. The computer (microcontroller) connected to the mouse will count 1 full turn of the scroller as 1 meter. The distance between the Promenade and the east side of Mahattan is about 900 meters. The person using the mouse is asked to meditate on where they are going while scrolling until they reach their destination. What's being measured here is probably just patience but also how many scrolls it takes to get to a given destination.

      For me this project is raising questions about immaterial labor, how to make scrolling material, how long can you scroll before you get tired, its just your pointer finger thats being used, how does the rest of the body feel, where is the mind, is this a meditative practice, is something slowed down? Thinking about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.onemilescroll.com">the one mile scroll</a> and David Horvitz's <a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2015/dec/09/space-between-us/" target="_blank">The Space Between Us.</a>

    <br><br>
    <p>
      I went with it. I connected my trusty PS2 mouse and a 7 Segment Digital counter to an Arduino. The mouse is sending a signal to the arduino on every time the scroll wheel moves forward or backward. The signal is then calculating the distance of that scroll in inches. The measurement is then displayed in real time on the display. With this particular mouse it takes about two rotations to move forward 1 inch.

      Whats next. I've found through this project that what I'm really interested is distance between human and computers. I think its important to acknowledge physical distance and metaphorical distance. I'm into this idea of being close to computers but really far away from understanding them. I'm thinking through this project about how to materialize immaterial distances and the labor that comes with traversing distance.

      I have decided spend time noticing the New York City skyline. I will focus specifically on a new construction which has already in its height altered the shape of the skyline if you are looking at it from the east side of the east river.
    </p>
    <div class="images lg">
      <img alt="" src="images/12.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p>
      This new construction is located at 161 Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Today I sat for 20 minutes on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade and <em>noticed</em> this building. I squinted my eyes to <em>see</em> if could see people, instead the only thing I saw moving was the construction elevator on the side of the building. I heard a lot of ambient noise and at times the sounds of helicopters above me or large trucks just below me.
      <br><br>
      There is a lot of controversy around the construction of this building. The developers have received a bunch of stop work orders due to unsafe working conditions. A construction worker fell to his death while working on this building.
      <br><br>
      <mark>
        im interested in noticing change in something that it is usually hard to see change in. in my experience buildings just pop up out of nowhere. sometimes they are under construction "forever", at times i can't even picture what was there before them
      </mark>
      It was an interesting day to watch the skyline. Today, 9/11/19 marks 18 years after the twin towers fell. They were once an iconic part of the skyline. On my way to the promenade I was listening to the radio and the show had invited on Mary Marshall, a historian and librarian, who has been putting together oral histories of 9/11 since it happened in 2001. A few people from in and around New York came onto the radio show to share their own stories. The histories were deep and ranging in terms of their perspective. One that stuck with me was the acknowledgement of the towers as a part of the speaker's architectural memory. In other words, she was always orienting herself in the city by looking up to see where the towers were.
      <br><br>
      I suppose I was left wondering what parts of New York play a part in my architectural memory. I remember getting out of the Broadway Lafayette station recently and being immeadiately disoriented in the directional sense. Even though I have exited this station so many times over many years the arrival of a new big glass construction taking up the entire southern block of Houston between Broadway and Crosby St threw me off.

      At one time there was a gas station there. Its so fucked up to feel some kind of nostalgia for a gas station but I guess this was one of the last left in a neighborhood that used to be referred to as "gasoline alley". There was also a <a href="http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2014/11/honest-boy-fruit-stand.html" target="_blank">fruit stand</a> which had been there since 1980 but closed in 2014.
