        what does it mean to notice something from afar? what will i pay attention to or be distracted by while trying to pay attention to the building? how is my experience of paying attention to this construction mediated by time, sound, place?

      I have decided spend time noticing the New York City skyline. I will focus specifically on a new construction which has already in its height altered the shape of the skyline if you are looking at it from the east side of the east river.

      This new construction is located at 161 Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Today I sat for 20 minutes on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade and <em>noticed</em> this building. I squinted my eyes to <em>see</em> if could see people, instead the only thing I saw moving was the construction elevator on the side of the building. I heard a lot of ambient noise and at times the sounds of helicopters above me or large trucks just below me.

        im interested in noticing change in something that it is usually hard to see change in. in my experience buildings just pop up out of nowhere. sometimes they are under construction "forever", at times i can't even picture what was there before them

      It was an interesting day to watch the skyline. Today, 9/11/19 marks 18 years after the twin towers collapsed, which were once an iconic part of the skyline. On my way to the promenade I was listening to the radio and the show had invited on Mary Marshall, a historian and library, who has been putting together oral histories of 9/11 since it happened in 2001. A few people from in and around New York came onto the radio show to share their own stories. The histories were deep and ranging in terms of their perspective. One that stucm with me was one person's acknowledgement of the towers are a part of her architectural memory. I suppose I was left wondering what parts of New York play a part in my architectural memory. I remember getting out of the Broadway Lafayette station recently and being immeadiately disoriented in terms of direction, even though I have exited this station so many times over many years, because a new big glass construction was nearly finished and taking up the entire southern block of Houston between Broadway and Crosby St where there once was a gas station. Its so fucked up to feel some kind of nostalgia for a gas station.

      Here is an image from an article that discusses the 61 Maiden Lane. There is a lot of controversy around the construction of this building. The developers have received a bunch of stop work orders due to unsafe working conditions. A construction worker fell to his death while working on this building.
