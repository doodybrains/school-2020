    <h2>clock</h2>
    <p>
      the clock, for me, has been a symbol for hyper-productivity. always racing the clock. which is why this weeks readings were kind of cathartic in that a clock can take many forms, affect and be affected by many things, but in the end it is always going. while i am on my computer i am always feeling that time is slipping away from. my time becomes computer time and computer time becomes my time. i would like to be in conversation with Tehching Hsieh for this assignment. also, thinking about what John Durham Peters said of the difference between clocks and calendars being their relationship to the day. what it would it mean to have to click a button, point to a clock, click on a clock and your computer took a picture of you, every minute for a full day. i haven't done too much research yet on Hsieh's piece but i'm curious about why he took the pictures, why he chose one year, why he chose the hour.
      <br><br>
      another thing im thinking about is to create a dropdown in the os or the browser which allows you to choose a "screen saver" from a set of options. Not "After 30 minutes" but "After I visit Facebook 30 times". the challenging part will be to set this apart from the every day app which monitors your "productivity" or locks down your phone after using social media.

      I was also reminded of Nick Seaver's syllabus for the class <a href="images/HTPA-syllabus-2.3.pdf">How to Pay Attention</a>, not dissimilar to the syllabus for this class.

      from <em>Ted Chiang, “Exhalation”</em>Thinking about social scientists and computer scientists who are working together on the model of neural nets, in which the brain is a mechanical entity, and therefore can be constructed by computation using similar mechanics. But this story blows that out of the water, where if we don't truly know how memory works how can we even begin to put trust in something that is modeled on it.

      from <em>John Durham Peters, “The Marvelous Clouds: Toward a Philosophy of Elemental Media.”</em>. on Chapter 5, <strong>"A calendar is a grid, but a clock is a pointer."</strong> The clock as always "ticking", as always now, constantly specifying. <strong>"The clock’s Umwelt is the sky."</strong>

    <p>
      <em>zeitgeber</em> cue that serves to regulate an organism's biological clock, like daylight. <br><br>
      Peters is marking differences between the calendar and the clock, the clock face as a non-arbitrary shape, rooted in the shape of the earth, as corresponding to direction and celestial bodies, calendars start with the day and expand upwards, clocks start with the day and expand downwards, but what is a <em>day</em>?

      <strong>"Every time in Heidegger that we read of watchfulness, shepherding being, or the event (Ereignis), we should think of weather, and remem- ber that he was reading the winds to carry weather balloons, airplanes, ordnance, and poison gas. Marvelous insights from a compromised con- text are not unusual for this thinker."</strong>

      <strong>"King Charles V of France ordered all the clocks of Paris in 1370 to follow the palace time “whether the sun shines or not” (luise le soleil ou non)."</strong>
      clock, comes from the word bell, which is an early and medieval and christian form of a clock, marking time, with a bell, jointly owned by church and state, as an act of power.

      <strong>"Many people have seen the air not as an empty and homoge- neous transparency but as a medium thickly inhabited by creatures and substances that affected mood and health (which, as we have seen, bells could control.)"</strong>

      <em>James Bridle, Phenological Mismatch</em> phenology, the study of periodical biological phenomena, not how things appear but when they appear.
      <br><br>
      while Robert Marshum's annual recordings found that change such as tempurature increased with time, it is hard to notice this increase or change within one generation. in the example of the caribou, because of warming oceans the spring is starting earlier meaning that plants are well on their way to growing before the caribou migrate back to them from the edge of the sea. by the time they get to them the plants have already lost a signifigant amount of nutrients. this is not only a <strong>trophic mismatch</strong> in which one species cannot count on another species for food survival, but also a <strong>phenological mismatch</strong> where one species is operating on a different clock due to shifting environmental conditions.

      the real transation of instagram as being emotional. as you having a certain feeling when choosing a filter, or i would argue, choosing which photo to post, of being an artist, feeling agency because you are choosing, feeling emotional because you are sharing something that is yours, close to you in some way, with "the world". Bridle is arguing that Instagram's most effective feature is its algorithmic timeline. <strong>"The algorithmic timeline is a deliberate phenological mismatch, reordering the flow of time itself to maximize the action/reward loop."</strong> the internet at large, facebook, google, etc will also experience phenological mismatch: "Increasing humidity and rainfall will change the refractive index of the atmosphere, leading to problems with microwave transmission and wi-fi propagation. Rising sea levels will overrun the beaches where cables come ashore and ever more frequent superstorms will make the repair and upkeep of long distance cable networks impossible."

      I feel a bit allergic to sensors in general. Who needs another sensor? Everything is already being sensored. There is an obvious argument here which is what <em>isn't</em> being captured and why.
      <br><br>
      I went to see Shannon Mattern talk at Columbia's GSAPP program. The talk was titled "Mapwashing: Co-Opting and Reclaiming Civic Design". It was interesting to be in a room of architecture / design students discussing big tech and the implications of geospatial mapping, data collection, and neoliberal urbanism, where cities emerge according to capitalistic power. Some things that I am still thinking about are the co-opting of a kind of inherent aesthetic of community planning, the illusion of community engagement in large corporate projects, and how maps can be much less evident of place than local data, community-built archives and oral histories, and how maps can also be so much more than just points and perimeters.
      <br><br>
      The talk got me thinking more deeply about my relationship to physical space through digital maps. How often I look at Google maps before I leave my house if I'm going to midtown or a neighborhood that I don't usually spend time in. How I quickly scroll and drag my cursor between subway stops and coffee shops so that I can make sure I know where everything is when I get there. How sometimes I make the choice of not looking at a map so that I can happen upon somewhere without preconception and how this makes me feel more connected to that place, how I more easily remember how I got there and what's around it.

      I think a lot about the <em>computer mouse</em>, its history, its teleology, in the context of this course I'm thinking about its potential to be used without a GUI.
      <br><br>
      Initial ideas: I would like to place a mouse in a physical space. Lets say the Brooklyn Heights Promenade (where my arts of noticing project is taking place). The signage near the mouse will instruct whoever is using the mouse to scroll the wheel until they arrive at a certain place, lets say the other side of the East River. The computer (microcontroller) connected to the mouse will count 1 full turn of the scroller as 1 meter. The distance between the Promenade and the east side of Mahattan is about 900 meters. The person using the mouse is asked to meditate on where they are going while scrolling until they reach their destination. What's being measured here is probably just patience but also how many scrolls it takes to get to a given destination.

      For me this project is raising questions about immaterial labor, how to make scrolling material, how long can you scroll before you get tired, its just your pointer finger thats being used, how does the rest of the body feel, where is the mind, is this a meditative practice, is something slowed down? Thinking about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.onemilescroll.com">the one mile scroll</a> and David Horvitz's <a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2015/dec/09/space-between-us/" target="_blank">The Space Between Us.</a>

      I went with it. I connected my trusty PS2 mouse and a 7 Segment Digital counter to an Arduino. The mouse is sending a signal to the arduino on every time the scroll wheel moves forward or backward. The signal is then calculating the distance of that scroll in inches. The measurement is then displayed in real time on the display. With this particular mouse it takes about two rotations to move forward 1 inch.

      Whats next. I've found through this project that what I'm really interested is distance between human and computers. I think its important to acknowledge physical distance and metaphorical distance. I'm into this idea of being close to computers but really far away from understanding them. I'm thinking through this project about how to materialize immaterial distances and the labor that comes with traversing distance.

        what does it mean to notice something from afar? what will i pay attention to or be distracted by while trying to pay attention to the building? how is my experience of paying attention to this construction mediated by time, sound, place?

      I have decided spend time noticing the New York City skyline. I will focus specifically on a new construction which has already in its height altered the shape of the skyline if you are looking at it from the east side of the east river.
    </p>
    <div class="images lg">
      <img alt="" src="images/12.jpg" />

      This new construction is located at 161 Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Today I sat for 20 minutes on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade and <em>noticed</em> this building. I squinted my eyes to <em>see</em> if could see people, instead the only thing I saw moving was the construction elevator on the side of the building. I heard a lot of ambient noise and at times the sounds of helicopters above me or large trucks just below me.
      <br><br>
      There is a lot of controversy around the construction of this building. The developers have received a bunch of stop work orders due to unsafe working conditions. A construction worker fell to his death while working on this building.
      <br><br>
      <mark>
        im interested in noticing change in something that it is usually hard to see change in. in my experience buildings just pop up out of nowhere. sometimes they are under construction "forever", at times i can't even picture what was there before them

      It was an interesting day to watch the skyline. Today, 9/11/19 marks 18 years after the twin towers fell. They were once an iconic part of the skyline. On my way to the promenade I was listening to the radio and the show had invited on Mary Marshall, a historian and librarian, who has been putting together oral histories of 9/11 since it happened in 2001. A few people from in and around New York came onto the radio show to share their own stories. The histories were deep and ranging in terms of their perspective. One that stuck with me was the acknowledgement of the towers as a part of the speaker's architectural memory. In other words, she was always orienting herself in the city by looking up to see where the towers were.
      <br><br>
      I suppose I was left wondering what parts of New York play a part in my architectural memory. I remember getting out of the Broadway Lafayette station recently and being immeadiately disoriented in the directional sense. Even though I have exited this station so many times over many years the arrival of a new big glass construction taking up the entire southern block of Houston between Broadway and Crosby St threw me off.

      At one time there was a gas station there. Its so fucked up to feel some kind of nostalgia for a gas station but I guess this was one of the last left in a neighborhood that used to be referred to as "gasoline alley". There was also a <a href="http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2014/11/honest-boy-fruit-stand.html" target="_blank">fruit stand</a> which had been there since 1980 but closed in 2014.
